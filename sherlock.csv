ELLA, How’s your blog going? 
JOHN," Mmm, fine! Good. Very good. "
ELLA, Written much? 
ELLA," John, it’s going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life ... "
JOHN, Sure. 
ELLA, ... and it will help so much to write about everything that’s happening to you. 
JOHN, Nothing happens to me. 
ANDERSON," As far as we can see, no marks on the body, no identification. "
LESTRADE, Same as the others? 
ANDERSON," Um, you’re not phoning ... him, are you? ’Cause we can handle this. We can absolutely handle it. "
LESTRADE, You’ve got work to do. 
MIKE, John! John Watson! 
MIKE, Stamford. Mike Stamford. We were at Bart’s together. 
JOHN," Yes, sorry, yes, Mike. (He takes Mike’s offered hand and shakes it.) Hello. "
MIKE," I heard you were abroad somewhere, getting shot at. What happened? "
JOHN," So you’re still at Bart’s, then? "
MIKE," Teaching now. Bright young things, like we used to be. God, I hate them! "
MIKE, What about you? Staying in town ’til you get yourself sorted? 
JOHN, Can’t afford London on an Army pension. 
JOHN, Who’d want me for a flatmate? 
JOHN, What? 
MIKE," Well, you’re the second person to say that to me today. "
JOHN, Who was the first? 
SHERLOCK, How fresh? 
MOLLY," Just in. Sixty-seven, natural causes. He used to work here – donated his body. I knew him. He was nice. "
SHERLOCK, Fine. We’ll start with the riding crop. 
SHERLOCK, I need to know what bruises form in the next twenty minutes. A man’s alibi depends on it. Text me. 
 I was wondering, maybe later ... 
SHERLOCK, Are you wearing lipstick? You weren’t wearing lipstick before. 
MOLLY, I just refreshed it a bit. 
SHERLOCK," Sorry, you were saying? "
SHERLOCK," Black, two sugars, please. I’ll be upstairs. "
MOLLY, ... Okay. 
 and the subject line reads, “Re: An impossible situation”. He types into the message box: 
uk , Please call me 
org , An impossible situation 
uk , RE: Church bell theft 
org , The curious cow 
com , Samson and Del 
net , Strange substance in pocket 
re, RE: Church bell theft”. In the message box he types: 
 The message reads simply, 
JOHN," Well, it’s a bit different from my day. "
SHERLOCK, I’d rather text. 
MIKE, Sorry. Other coat. 
JOHN," Oh, here. Use mine. "
MIKE," It’s an old mate of mine, John Watson. "
SHERLOCK, Afghanistan or Iraq? 
JOHN," Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you know ...? "
SHERLOCK," Ah, coffee. Thank you, Molly. "
SHERLOCK, What happened to the lipstick? 
SHERLOCK, Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Mouth’s too small now. 
JOHN," I’m sorry, what? "
JOHN," Oh, you told him about me? "
JOHN, How did you know about Afghanistan? 
SHERLOCK, Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we could afford it. We’ll meet there tomorrow evening; seven o’clock. 
SHERLOCK, Sorry – I’ve gotta dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary. 
JOHN, Is that it? 
SHERLOCK, Is that what? 
JOHN, We’ve just met and we’re gonna go and look at a flat? 
SHERLOCK, Problem? 
JOHN, We don’t know a thing about each other; I don’t know your name; I don’t even know where we’re meeting. 
SHERLOCK, I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve recently been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother with a bit of money who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. 
SHERLOCK," And I know your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid. "
SHERLOCK," That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think? "
SHERLOCK, The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is two two one B Baker Street. 
SHERLOCK, Afternoon. 
MIKE, Yeah. He’s always like that. 
SHERLOCK," Mrs Hudson, our landlady. "
JOHN," Ah, Mr Holmes. "
SHERLOCK," Sherlock, please. "
SHERLOCK," Getting a special rate. Owes me a favour. A few years ago, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out. "
JOHN, You stopped her husband being executed? 
SHERLOCK, Oh no. I ensured it. 
MRS HUDSON," Sherlock, hello. "
MRS HUDSON," Come in, come in! "
JOHN," Well, this could be very nice. Very nice indeed. "
SHERLOCK," Yes, I think so. My thoughts exactly. "
SHERLOCK, So I went ahead and moved in. 
JOHN, So ... this is all your stuff. 
SHERLOCK, Obviously I can straighten things up ... a bit. 
JOHN, That’s a real skull. 
SHERLOCK," Friend of mine. Well, I say ‘friend’ ... "
MRS HUDSON," What d’you think, Doctor Watson? "
JOHN," Well, of course we’ll be needing two. "
MRS HUDSON," Oh, don’t worry; there’s all sorts round here. Mrs Turner next door’s got married ones. "
MRS HUDSON, Sherlock. The mess you’ve made. 
JOHN," Oh, I, um, looked you up on the internet last night. "
JOHN," Found your website, The Science of Deduction. "
SHERLOCK, What did you think? 
JOHN," Quite amusing, I suppose. "
SHERLOCK, “Amusing”? 
JOHN, You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and – what was it? – a retired plumber by his left hand. 
SHERLOCK," Yes; and I can read your military career by your face and your leg, and your brother’s drinking habits by your mobile phone. "
SHERLOCK, You read the article. 
JOHN, The article was absurd. 
MRS HUDSON," What about these suicides then, Sherlock? Thought that’d be right up your street. Been a fourth one now. "
SHERLOCK," Yes, actually. Very much up my street. "
 Can I just ask, what is your street? 
SHERLOCK, Where this time? 
LESTRADE," Brixton, Lauriston Gardens. Will you come? "
SHERLOCK, Who’s on forensics? 
LESTRADE, It’s Anderson. 
SHERLOCK, Anderson won’t work with me. 
LESTRADE, He won’t be your assistant. 
SHERLOCK, But I need an assistant. 
LESTRADE, Will you come? 
SHERLOCK, Not in a police car. I’ll be right behind. 
LESTRADE, Thank you. 
SHERLOCK, Oh! Brilliant! 
SHERLOCK, Thought it was gonna be a dull evening. 
SHERLOCK," Mrs Hudson, I may be out late. Might need some food. "
MRS HUDSON," I’m your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper. "
SHERLOCK," Something cold will do. John, make yourself at home. Er, have a cup of tea. Don’t wait up. "
MRS HUDSON," Look at him, dashing about! My husband was just the same. "
MRS HUDSON," But you’re more the sitting-down type, I can tell. "
JOHN, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that sometimes this bloody thing ... 
MRS HUDSON," I understand, dear; I’ve got a hip. "
JOHN," A cup of tea would be lovely, thank you. "
MRS HUDSON," Just this once, dear. I’m not your housekeeper. "
SHERLOCK, You’re a doctor. 
SHERLOCK, In fact you’re an Army doctor. 
SHERLOCK, Any good? 
JOHN, Very good. 
SHERLOCK," Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths. "
JOHN," Well, yes. "
SHERLOCK," Bit of trouble too, I bet. "
SHERLOCK, Wanna see some more? 
SHERLOCK," Come on, then. "
JOHN," Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I’ll skip the cuppa. Off out. "
SHERLOCK, No point sitting at home when there’s finally some halfway interesting murders! 
MRS HUDSON," Look at you, all happy. It’s not decent. "
SHERLOCK, Taxi! 
SHERLOCK," Okay, you’ve got questions. "
JOHN, Where are we going? 
SHERLOCK, Crime scene. There’s been a murder. Next? 
JOHN, Who are you? What do you do? 
SHERLOCK, What do you think? 
JOHN," I’d say private detective, but ... "
SHERLOCK, But? 
JOHN, ... the police don’t go to private detectives. 
SHERLOCK, I’m a consulting detective. I’m the only one in the world. I invented the job. 
JOHN, What does that mean? 
SHERLOCK," It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me. "
JOHN," But the police don’t consult ... (he pauses for a long moment, apparently reluctant to use the word) ... amateurs. "
SHERLOCK," When I met you for the first time yesterday and asked, “Afghanistan or Iraq?” you looked surprised. "
JOHN, How did you know? 
SHERLOCK," I didn’t know, I saw. "
SHERLOCK," Tanned face but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. Your haircut and the way you hold yourself says military. Your conversation when you entered the room ... "
SHERLOCK," ... says trained at Bart’s, so Army doctor, obvious. "
SHERLOCK," Your limp’s really bad when you walk but you don’t ask for a chair when you stand, like you’ve forgotten about it. That means the limp is at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatising. Wounded in action, then. So: where does an Army doctor get himself a suntan and wounded in action these days? Afghanistan or Iraq. "
JOHN, You said I had a therapist. 
SHERLOCK, You’ve got a psychosomatic limp – of course you’ve got a therapist. 
SHERLOCK, Then there’s your brother. 
SHERLOCK," Scratches. Not just one, but many over time. It’s been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting beside me wouldn’t treat his one luxury item like this. It’s had a previous owner, then. The next bit’s easy. You know it already. "
JOHN, The engraving. 
SHERLOCK," Harry Watson: clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone. Not your father; this is a young man’s gadget. Could be a cousin, but then you’re a war hero returning home who can’t find a place to live. Unlikely you’ve got an extended family, certainly not one you’re close to, so brother it is. Now, Clara. Who’s Clara? Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She’s given this to him recently – the model’s only six months old. So, it’s a marriage in trouble, then – six months on he’s just given it away. If she’d left him, he’d have kept the phone, probably. People do – sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you; that says he wants you to stay in touch. He’s worried about you. "
SHERLOCK," You’re looking for cheap accommodation, but you won’t go to your brother for help. That says you’ve got problems with him. "
SHERLOCK, Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you don’t like his drinking. 
JOHN, How can you possibly know about the drinking? 
SHERLOCK," Shot in the dark. Good one, though. "
 Power connection, tiny scuff marks around the edge of it. 
SHERLOCK, Every night he plugs it in to recharge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them. 
SHERLOCK," There you go, you see – you were right. "
JOHN, I was right? Right about what? 
SHERLOCK, The police don’t consult amateurs. 
JOHN, That was ... amazing. 
SHERLOCK, Do you think so? 
JOHN, Of course it was! It was extraordinary! It was quite extraordinary! 
JOHN, What do they usually say? 
SHERLOCK, ‘Piss off’! 
SHERLOCK, Did I get anything wrong? 
JOHN," Harry and me don’t get on, never have. Harry and Clara are getting a divorce – split up three months ago; Harry’s a drinker. "
JOHN, Harry’s short for Harriet. 
SHERLOCK, Harry’s your sister? 
JOHN," Now, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here? "
JOHN," No, seriously, why am I here? "
DONOVAN," Hello, freak. "
SHERLOCK, I’m here to see Inspector Lestrade. 
DONOVAN, Why? 
SHERLOCK, I was invited. 
DONOVAN, Why? 
SHERLOCK," Colleague of mine, Doctor Watson. Doctor Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan. (His voice drips with sarcasm.) Old friend. "
DONOVAN, A colleague? How did you get a colleague?! 
DONOVAN, Did he follow you home? 
JOHN, Would it be better if I just go ... 
SHERLOCK," Ah, Anderson. Here we are again. "
ANDERSON, It’s a crime scene. I don’t want it contaminated. Are we clear on that? 
SHERLOCK, Quite clear. 
ANDERSON, Your magic tricks might impress Inspector Lestrade – they don’t work on me. 
SHERLOCK, And is your wife away for long? 
ANDERSON," Oh, don’t pretend you worked that out. Someone told you that. "
SHERLOCK, Your deodorant told me that. 
ANDERSON, My deodorant? 
SHERLOCK, It’s for men. 
ANDERSON," Well, of course it’s for men! I’m wearing it! "
SHERLOCK, So’s Sergeant Donovan. 
SHERLOCK," Ooh, and I think it just vaporised. May I go in? "
ANDERSON, Whatever it is you’re trying to imply ... 
SHERLOCK," And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees. "
LESTRADE, You have two minutes. 
SHERLOCK, May need longer. 
SHERLOCK, Put this on. 
LESTRADE, Who’s this? 
LESTRADE," Yeah, but who is he? "
SHERLOCK, I told you; he’s with me. 
SHERLOCK," So, where are we? "
LESTRADE," Footprint analysis says that the only other person in this room in the last twelve hours was a man of about five foot seven. It seemed that he and the victim arrived together by car. All identification’s missing from the body, just like the others. Have no idea who she is or where she’s from."
SHERLOCK," Well, she’s from out of town, clearly. Planned to spend a single night in London before returning home. So far, so obvious."
LESTRADE, Obvious?
SHERLOCK," Yes, obvious. Back of the right leg."
SHERLOCK," Doctor Watson, what do you think?"
JOHN, What do I think?
SHERLOCK, You’re the medical man.
LESTRADE, We have a whole team right outside.
LESTRADE," Look, I’m breaking every rule letting you in here."
LESTRADE," Yes, I do, God help me."
SHERLOCK, John.
SHERLOCK, Well?
JOHN, Fun? There’s a woman lying dead.
SHERLOCK," No, there are two women and three men lying dead. Keep talking and there’ll be more. (Louder, so that Lestrade can hear him) Now, cause of death."
JOHN," Asphyxiation, probably. She passed out and choked on her own vomit. I can’t smell any alcohol on her. Could be a seizure; possibly drugs."
SHERLOCK, It was poison.
JOHN, How do you know?
SHERLOCK, Because they were all poisoned.
JOHN, By who?
SHERLOCK, By themselves.
JOHN, Themselves?
LESTRADE, We’ve identified the drug ...
SHERLOCK, Same pattern each time.
SHERLOCK," Each one of them disappears from their normal lives ... (he bends closer and sniffs at her palm and nails) ... from the theatre, from their home, from the office, from the pub ..."
SHERLOCK, ... then turn up a few hours later somewhere they’ve no reason to be ...
SHERLOCK," No marks of violence on the body, no suggestion of compulsion."
SHERLOCK," Each of them has taken the same poison – and, as far as we can tell, taken it voluntarily."
LESTRADE," Sherlock – two minutes, I said. I need anything you’ve got."
SHERLOCK," Okay, take this down."
SHERLOCK, I’m not gonna write it down.
SHERLOCK," Thank you. The victim is in her early thirties. A professional person, going by her clothes; I’d guess something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink. She’s travelled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night. That’s obvious from the size of her suitcase."
LESTRADE, Suitcase?
SHERLOCK," Her suitcase, yes. "
SHERLOCK," She’s been married several years, but not happily. She’s had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married."
LESTRADE," For God’s sake, if you’re just making this up ..."
LESTRADE, Cardiff?
JOHN, It’s not obvious to me.
SHERLOCK, Dear God. What’s it like inside your funny little brains? It must be so boring.
SHERLOCK," Her coat: slightly damp. She’s been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London until the last few minutes. Under her coat collar is damp, too. She’s turned it up against the wind. "
SHERLOCK," There’s an umbrella in her left pocket but it’s dry and unused: not just wind, strong wind – too strong to use her umbrella. We know from the suitcase that she intended to stay a night, so she must have come a decent distance but she can’t have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn’t dried. So, where has there been heavy rain and strong winds within the radius of that travel time?"
SHERLOCK, Cardiff.
SHERLOCK, D’you know you do that out loud?
LESTRADE, There was no suitcase.
SHERLOCK, I’m sorry?
LESTRADE, She had a handbag. Why’d you say she had a case?
SHERLOCK, Because she did. Her handbag – was there a mobile phone in it?
LESTRADE, No.
SHERLOCK, That’s odd. That’s very odd.
LESTRADE, Why?
SHERLOCK, Never mind. We need to find her case.
JOHN, How do you know she had a case?
 Back of the right leg," tiny splash marks above the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don’t get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, judging by the spread. A case that size, woman this clothes-conscious: could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying the night."
JOHN," Maybe she checked into a hotel, left her case there."
SHERLOCK, She never made it to a hotel. Look at her hair. Colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. A woman like that would never leave the hotel with her hair still looking that ...
SHERLOCK, Oh.
SHERLOCK, Oh!
JOHN, Sherlock?
LESTRADE," Well, we can’t just wait!"
SHERLOCK," Oh, we’re done waiting! When she was found, she couldn’t have been here long, is that right?"
LESTRADE," No, not long at all – um, less than an hour."
SHERLOCK, News blackout: can you do that? Don’t say that you’ve found her; nothing for a day.
LESTRADE, Why?
SHERLOCK," Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake."
SHERLOCK, Back in a moment!
LESTRADE, Anderson!
ANDERSON, I’m here.
ANDERSON, So? What was the point in all that?
LESTRADE, We’re after a psychopath.
ANDERSON, So we’re bringing in another psychopath to help?!
LESTRADE, If that’s what it takes.
LESTRADE, All yours.
ANDERSON," Right, come on."
JOHN," My notes – d’you want me to, er ..."
LESTRADE," Sorry, you’re ...?"
JOHN, Doctor Watson.
LESTRADE," Well, you’re gonna have to go, Doctor Watson. Don’t need your notes."
LESTRADE," Okay, let’s get on with it."
DONOVAN," Okay, look, we’re gonna need Jones and Adams at the top of the road. There’s so many people around ..."
DONOVAN, He’s gone.
JOHN," What, Sherlock Holmes?"
DONOVAN, He just took off. He does that.
JOHN, Is he coming back?
DONOVAN, Didn’t look like it.
JOHN, Right.
JOHN, Right ... Yes.
JOHN," Um, sorry, where am I?"
JOHN," Right. D’you know where I’d, er, get a cab? It’s just, my leg."
DONOVAN, Hey.
JOHN, (stopping and turning back to her): Hmm.
DONOVAN, You’re not his friend – he doesn’t have friends – so who are you?
JOHN, Me? I’m ... I’m nobody. I just met him.
DONOVAN," Right, bit of advice then: stay away from that guy."
JOHN, Why?
DONOVAN," You know why he’s here? He’s not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it. The weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what? One day just showing up isn’t gonna be enough. One day we’ll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes’ll be the one who put it there."
JOHN, Why would he do that?
DONOVAN, Because he’s a psychopath. And psychopaths get bored.
DONOVAN, Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.
JOHN, Thanks.
DONOVAN, No worries.
 It reads, 
 The new message reads, 
 The latest message simply reads, 
TAXI DRIVER, You late or something?
TAXI DRIVER, Sorry. You just look a bit ... wired.
JOHN, What are you doing?
SHERLOCK, Nicotine patch. Helps me think. Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work.
JOHN," Well, it’s good news for breathing."
SHERLOCK, Breathing’s boring.
JOHN, Is that three patches?
SHERLOCK, It’s a three-patch problem.
JOHN, Well?
JOHN, You asked me to come. Took me an hour to get here. I assume it’s important.
SHERLOCK," Oh, yeah. Can I borrow your phone?"
JOHN, My phone?
SHERLOCK, Don’t wanna use mine. Always a chance the number will be recognised. It’s on the website.
JOHN, Mrs Hudson’s got a phone.
SHERLOCK," Yeah, but she’s downstairs. I tried shouting but she didn’t hear."
JOHN, Here. Here.
JOHN, So what’s this about – the case?
SHERLOCK, Her case.
JOHN, Her case?
SHERLOCK," Her suitcase, yes. The murderer took her suitcase. First big mistake."
SHERLOCK," It’s no use, there’s no other way. We’ll have to risk it."
JOHN, Risk what?
SHERLOCK, I want you to send a text.
JOHN, Who am I texting?
SHERLOCK," Never mind. On the table, the number, now, please."
JOHN, Maybe Sergeant Donovan was right about you.
JOHN, Said you were a psychopath.
SHERLOCK, Oh! Didn’t think she was that smart!
JOHN, She said one day they’re gonna show up at a murder scene and you’ll have provided the body.
 These words exactly, “What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.”
SHERLOCK, “Twenty-two Northumberland Terrace. Please come.”
SHERLOCK, Well? Send it.
SHERLOCK, Have you sent it?
SHERLOCK, Take a look at the impossible.
SHERLOCK, The contents of her case.
JOHN, How did you get this?
SHERLOCK, By looking.
JOHN, Where?
SHERLOCK," We know the killer drove to Lauriston Gardens. We know the killer is a man. No man could be seen with this case without attracting attention to himself, so obviously he’d feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he knew it was still in his car. Wouldn’t have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake."
SHERLOCK, I checked every back street wide enough for a car within five minutes of Lauriston Gardens ...
SHERLOCK, ... and looked for anywhere you could easily dispose of a bulky object without being observed.
SHERLOCK, Took me less than an hour to find the right skip.
JOHN, Pink. You got all that because you realised the case’d be pink?
SHERLOCK, Because you’re stupid.
SHERLOCK," Oh no, don’t look like that. Practically everyone is."
SHERLOCK, Sent?
SHERLOCK, The contents of her case – look at them.
JOHN, What am I looking for?
SHERLOCK, The impossible. The one impossible thing.
JOHN," There’s a change of clothes, a make-up bag, a washbag and a novel. (He sits back.) What’s impossible?"
SHERLOCK, Her mobile phone. 
JOHN, There isn’t a mobile phone.
SHERLOCK," That’s what’s impossible. No mobile in her case, no mobile in her coat pocket."
JOHN," Well, maybe she doesn’t have one."
SHERLOCK, She has a string of lovers. Of course she has one.
JOHN, She could have left it at home.
SHERLOCK," Again, string of lovers. She never leaves her phone at home."
JOHN, And so where is it?
SHERLOCK," You know where it is. More importantly, you know who has it."
JOHN, The murderer?
JOHN, Who did I just text?
SHERLOCK," Maybe she just dropped it in the back of his car; maybe she planted it on purpose to lead us to him, but the murderer has her phone."
SHERLOCK, A few hours since his last victim. Now he’s received a text which can only be from her. An innocent man would ignore a text like that; assume it was a mistake. A guilty man ...
JOHN, Have you spoken to the police?
SHERLOCK, Five people are dead. There isn’t time to talk to the police.
JOHN, Then why are you talking to me?
SHERLOCK, You’re here.
SHERLOCK, Well?
JOHN, Well what?
SHERLOCK," Well, you could sit there and watch telly."
SHERLOCK, Problem?
JOHN, Sergeant Donovan.
SHERLOCK, What about her?
JOHN, Said you get off on this. You enjoy it.
JOHN, Damn it!
JOHN, Where are we going?
SHERLOCK, Northumberland Terrace is a five-minute walk from here.
JOHN," What, you think he’s stupid enough to go there?"
SHERLOCK, No – I think he’s brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones – so desperate to get caught.
JOHN, Why?
SHERLOCK, Appreciation. At long last the spotlight. To you it’s an arrest; to them it’s a coming-out party. That’s the frailty of genius: it needs an audience.
JOHN, Yeah.
JOHN, Yes. I suppose it does.
SHERLOCK, Twenty-two Northumberland Terrace. Keep your eyes on it.
SHERLOCK, I am.
JOHN," But he’s not just gonna ring the doorbell, though, is he?"
SHERLOCK," No, of course not. But he’ll pass by; might even loiter."
JOHN, Half of London’s passing by.
SHERLOCK, I’ll recognise him.
JOHN, You know who he is?
SHERLOCK, I know what he is.
ANGELO," Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free."
ANGELO," All on the house, you and your date."
ANGELO, He got me off a murder charge.
SHERLOCK," This is Angelo. Three years ago I successfully proved to Inspector Lestrade that at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder, Angelo was in a completely different part of town, car-jacking."
SHERLOCK, I cleared it a bit.
SHERLOCK," Thank you, Angelo."
ANGELO," If not for you, I’d have gone to prison."
SHERLOCK, You did go to prison.
SHERLOCK, You may as well eat. We might be waiting a long time.
JOHN, Hmm. Are you going to?
SHERLOCK, What day is it?
JOHN, It’s Wednesday.
SHERLOCK, I’m okay for a bit.
JOHN," You haven’t eaten today? For God’s sake, you need to eat."
SHERLOCK," No, you need to eat. I need to think. The brain’s what counts. Everything else is transport."
JOHN, You might consider refuelling.
JOHN, So – d’you have a girlfriend who feeds you up sometimes?
SHERLOCK, Is that what girlfriends do: feed you up? 
JOHN," You don’t have a girlfriend, then?"
JOHN, Mm.
JOHN, Oh. Right. D’you have a boyfriend?
JOHN," Which is fine, by the way."
SHERLOCK, I know it’s fine.
JOHN, So you don’t have a boyfriend then?
SHERLOCK, No.
JOHN," Fine. Okay. So, unattached, like me. (He looks down at his menu, apparently rapidly running out of things to say.) Good."
SHERLOCK," John, you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I’m flattered by your interest, I’m really not looking for any kind of ..."
JOHN, I wasn’t asking you out. No.
JOHN," I’m just saying, it’s all fine. Whatever ... shakes your ... (he looks up in confusion as he searches for the right word) ... boat. I’m gonna shut up now."
SHERLOCK, I think that’s for the best.
JOHN, So ...
JOHN, ... you don’t ... do ... anything.
JOHN," No sign yet, then?"
SHERLOCK, I suppose it is a long shot. We have to be realistic.
JOHN, You said before you didn’t know who the killer was but you knew what.
SHERLOCK, So do you if you think about it. 
SHERLOCK, Why don’t people just think?
JOHN," Oh, because we’re stupid."
SHERLOCK," We know the killer drove his victims, but there were no marks of coercion or violence on the bodies. Each one of those five people climbed into a stranger’s car voluntarily. The killer was someone they trusted."
JOHN, But not someone they knew?
SHERLOCK," Five completely different people. They had no friends in common. And another thing: Lauriston Gardens, did you see it? Twitching curtains, little old ladies ... Little old ladies, they’re my favourite. Better than any security cameras. But according to the police, no-one remembers a strange car parked outside an empty house. Not one person remembered."
JOHN, I see what you’re saying.
JOHN, ... No I don’t. What are you saying: that the killer’s got an invisible car?
SHERLOCK, Yes. Yes! Exactly!
JOHN, Then I definitely don’t see what you’re saying.
SHERLOCK," There are cars that pass like ghosts, unseen, unremembered. There are people we trust, always, when we’re alone, when we’re lost, when we’re drunk. We never see their faces, but every day we disappear into their cars and let the trap close around us."
SHERLOCK," Angelo, glass of white wine, quickly."
SHERLOCK," I give you the perfect murder weapon of the modern age, the invisible car."
SHERLOCK, The London cab.
JOHN, There’s been cabs up and down this street all night.
JOHN, He’s looking for a fare.
JOHN, We don’t know it’s him.
SHERLOCK, We don’t know it isn’t.
SHERLOCK, Thank you.
SHERLOCK," Angelo, headless nun."
ANGELO," Ah, now that was a case!"
ANGELO, Same again?
SHERLOCK, If you wouldn’t mind.
ANGELO, Out of my restaurant! Cretino! You’re drunk!
ANGELO, And stay away!
JOHN, What’s he doing?
ANGELO, Sherlock’s on the case. Bad news for bad people.
CABBIE," Sorry, mate, off duty."
SHERLOCK, Two two one ... (he stifles a burp) ... B Baker Street.
CABBIE," I’m not on duty, mate. You see the light?"
SHERLOCK, Jus’ round the corner! It’s Baker Street!
CABBIE, There’s plenty of other cabs round ’ere. Get another cab.
SHERLOCK, Two two one B!
CABBIE," I’m not on duty, an’ I don’t do drunks."
CABBIE, ’ello?
CABBIE, What? What did ... what did you say?
SHERLOCK," I said, how do you make them take the poison?"
SHERLOCK, Sherlock Holmes.
CABBIE," Do a lot of drugs, Sherlock ’olmes?"
SHERLOCK, Not in a while.
CABBIE, I ask ’cause you’re very resilient.
CABBIE, Most people would have passed out by now.
ANGELO, It’s okay. All part of the plan.
CABBIE, It’s okay. He’s just had a few.
CABBIE, Look at the state of ’im!
CABBIE," Trouble is, your friends all think you’re acting."
CABBIE, That’s the thing about people.
CABBIE, They’re all stupid.
JOHN, Something’s gone wrong.
ANGELO," No, no, no. All part of the plan."
ANGELO, Sherlock always has a plan.
JOHN," Yes, and it’s gone wrong."
CABBIE," I ’ope you don’t mind. Well, you gave me your address."
CABBIE, You’ve only been out for about ten minutes.
CABBIE, You’re strong. I’m impressed.
CABBIE, That’s right – you warm yourself up. I made everything nice and cosy for you.
CABBIE," Course it is, yeah. (He takes a set of keys from his trouser pocket and holds them up.) Found your keys in your jacket. I thought, well, why not? People like to die at ’ome."
CABBIE," Now, now. The drug’s still in your system. (He walks closer and looks down at Sherlock.) You’ll be weak as a kitten for at least an hour."
CABBIE," I could do anything I wanted to you right now, Mr ’olmes."
CABBIE, Anything at all.
CABBIE, But don’t worry. I’m only gonna kill yer.
CABBIE," The whole ’ouse is empty. Even your landlady’s away, so there’s no point in raising your voice. We’re all locked in, nice and snug."
SHERLOCK," Still, bit of a risk, isn’t it? Here?"
CABBIE, You call that a risk?
CABBIE, This is a risk.
CABBIE, You wanted to know ’ow I made ’em take the poison.
CABBIE, You’re gonna love this!
SHERLOCK, How?
CABBIE, Take a moment.
CABBIE, Get yourself together. I want your best game.
SHERLOCK, My ... my best what?
CABBIE," I know who you are, Mr ’olmes."
CABBIE," The moment you said your name, I knew. Sherlock ’olmes."
CABBIE, I’ve been on your website loads of times. You are brilliant.
CABBIE, You are. Proper genius.
CABBIE," “The Science of Deduction.” Now that is proper thinking. Between you and me, why can’t people think?"
CABBIE, Don’t it drive you mad? Why can’t people just think?
SHERLOCK, Who are you?
CABBIE, Nobody. (He looks down at Sherlock.) For now.
CABBIE," But I won’t die a nobody, now will I?"
SHERLOCK, Two pills.
CABBIE," There’s a good pill and a bad pill. You take the good pill, you live; take the bad pill, you die."
SHERLOCK, And you know which is which.
CABBIE, Course I know.
SHERLOCK, But I don’t.
CABBIE, Wouldn’t be a game if you knew. You’re the one who chooses.
SHERLOCK, It’s not a game. It’s chance.
CABBIE," I’ve played five times. I’m alive. It’s not chance, Mr ’olmes, it’s chess. It’s a game of chess, with one move, and one survivor. And this ... this is the move."
CABBIE, Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? You can choose either one.
SHERLOCK," That’s what you did, to all of them. You gave them a choice."
CABBIE," You’ve gotta admit: as serial killers go, I’m verging on nice! Anyway, time’s up. Choose."
SHERLOCK, And then?
CABBIE," And then, together, we take our medicine."
CABBIE, Let’s play.
CABBIE," You’re not playin’ the numbers, you’re playin’ me. Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill?"
CABBIE, Is it a bluff? Or a double-bluff? Or a triple-bluff?
CABBIE, Five people in a row? It’s not chance.
SHERLOCK, It’s luck.
CABBIE," It’s genius. I know ’ow people think. I know ’ow people think I think. I can see it all, like a map in my ’ead."
CABBIE, Everyone’s so stupid – even you.
CABBIE," Course, maybe God just loves me."
SHERLOCK," Either way, you’re wasted as a cabbie."
SHERLOCK, How did you choose which ones?
CABBIE," Anyone who didn’t know where they were going, ’cause they were drunk or lost or new in town."
CABBIE, Anyone I could walk through the wrong door.
SHERLOCK, You risked your life five times just to kill strangers.
SHERLOCK," You’re dying, aren’t you?"
CABBIE, So are you.
SHERLOCK," You don’t have long, though. Am I right?"
CABBIE, Aneurism.
CABBIE, Right in ’ere.
CABBIE," Any breath could be my last. It’s your only ’ope, Mr ’olmes. Bet on the aneurism."
SHERLOCK, I’m not a betting man.
CABBIE, D’you think I’m bitter?
SHERLOCK, What if I don’t take either?
CABBIE," Then I choose for you, and I force it down your throat. Right now there’s nothing you could do to stop me."
SHERLOCK, Especially as that’s the police.
CABBIE, I know. (He turns his head to glance over his shoulder at the flashing lights reflecting on the window pane.) I’m not blind.
CABBIE," You make the slightest move towards that phone, I’ll kill yer."
CABBIE, You wanna risk it?
CABBIE, Wouldn’t you rather risk this?
CABBIE, Which one do you think? Which one’s the good pill?
CABBIE, Come on. I know you’ve got a theory.
CABBIE, Oh. Interesting.
CABBIE, So what d’you think? Shall we?
CABBIE," Really, what do you think? Can you beat me?"
CABBIE," I bet you get bored, don’t you? A man like you, so clever. I’ll bet you’re not bored now."
CABBIE," This ... this right now – this is what you live for, innit, not being bored?"
LESTRADE, Did anyone see it? Where did it come from? Who is firing? Who is firing?
LESTRADE, Clear the area! Clear the area now!
SHERLOCK, Why have I got this blanket?
SHERLOCK, They keep putting this blanket on me.
LESTRADE, It’s for shock.
LESTRADE," Yeah, but some of the guys wanna take photographs."
SHERLOCK," So, the shooter wasn’t one of yours, then."
LESTRADE," God, no. We didn’t have time. But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose. One of them could have been following him. Whoever it was, he was gone by the time we got there and we’ve got nothing to go on."
SHERLOCK," Oh, I wouldn’t say that."
LESTRADE," Okay, gimme."
LESTRADE, I’ll write it down this time.
SHERLOCK," The bullet they just dug out of my wall was from a hand gun. A shot clean through the heart over that distance with that kind of a weapon – that’s a crack shot you’re looking for, but not just a marksman; a fighter. His hand couldn’t have shaken at all, so clearly he was acclimatised to violence."
SHERLOCK," He didn’t fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principles. You’re looking for a man probably with a history of military service, nerves of steel ..."
SHERLOCK," Actually, do you know what? Um, ignore me."
LESTRADE, I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK, Ignore what I just said. It’s the shock talking.
SHERLOCK, Probably need this blanket.
SHERLOCK, I just need to discuss the rent.
LESTRADE, Sherlock ...
SHERLOCK, I’m sorry?
LESTRADE, Did you choose the right pill?
SHERLOCK," I dunno. In all the confusion, I lost track. I don’t know which I chose."
LESTRADE, Maybe he beat you.
JOHN, Sergeant Donovan’s been explaining everything to me. It’s ... the two pills? Dreadful business. Dreadful.
SHERLOCK, Where is it?
SHERLOCK, Don’t. Just don’t. What did you do with the gun?
JOHN," Oh, er, bottom of the Thames."
SHERLOCK," We need to get rid of the powder burns in your finger. I don’t suppose you’d serve time for this, but let’s avoid the court case."
JOHN," I ran after the cab, called the police, of course, and then I thought, better keep an eye on you."
SHERLOCK, Are you all right?
JOHN, Of course I’m all right.
SHERLOCK, You have just killed a man.
JOHN, I’ll sleep fine tonight.
JOHN," You were gonna take the damned pill, weren’t you?"
SHERLOCK, Course not. Playing for time.
JOHN," No, you weren’t. It’s how you get your kicks, isn’t it? Risking your life to prove you’re clever."
SHERLOCK, Why would I do that?
JOHN, ’Cause you’re an idiot.
SHERLOCK, Dinner?
JOHN, Starving.
SHERLOCK," There’s a good Chinese at the end of the road, stays open ’til two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle."
LESTRADE, Oi! Sherlock!
LESTRADE, Still got questions for you.
JOHN," Er, Inspector Lestrade, to my certain knowledge, this man hasn’t eaten for several days."
LESTRADE, And who the hell are you?
LESTRADE," Okay, I’ll pull you in tomorrow. Off you go."
JOHN, Thank you.
SHERLOCK, So: ran after a cab. Told you that limp was psychosomatic.
JOHN, I knew it was.
SHERLOCK," You did get shot, though."
JOHN," Oh, yeah. In the shoulder."
SHERLOCK, Oh!
MRS HUDSON, Sherlock! What have you done to my house?
SHERLOCK," Nothing wrong with your house, Mrs Hudson, which is more than can be said for the dead serial killer on the first floor."
MRS HUDSON, Dead what?!
SHERLOCK, Good news for London; bad news for your carpet.
SHERLOCK," Good night, Mrs Hudson."
MRS HUDSON, I’m not your housekeeper!
JOHN," Night, Mrs Hudson!"
LESTRADE, Sergeant Donovan.
DONOVAN, Sir?
DONOVAN," What two, sir? "
  ELLA," How’s your blog going?  JOHN: Yeah, good. (He clears his throat awkwardly.) Very good.  ELLA: You haven’t written a word, have you?  JOHN (pointing to Ella’s notepad on her lap): You just wrote, “Still has trust issues.”  ELLA: And you read my writing upside down. D’you see what I mean?  (John smiles awkwardly.)  ELLA: John, you’re a soldier, and it’s gonna take you a while to adjust to civilian life; and writing a blog about everything that happens to you will honestly help you.  (John gazes back at her, his face full of despair.)  JOHN: Nothing happens to me.   Opening credits.   OCTOBER 12TH. A well-dressed middle-aged business man walks across the concourse of a busy London railway station talking into his mobile phone.  SIR JEFFREY: What d’you mean, there’s no ruddy car?  (His secretary is at his office talking into her phone as she walks across the room.)  HELEN: He went to Waterloo. I’m sorry. Get a cab.  SIR JEFFREY: I never get cabs.  (Helen looks around furtively to make sure that nobody is within earshot, then speaks quietly into the phone.)  HELEN: I love you.  SIR JEFFREY (suggestively): When?  HELEN (giggling): Get a cab!  (Smiling as he hangs up, Sir Jeffrey looks around for the cab rank.)   Some unspecified time later, sitting on the floor by the window of what appears to be an office many storeys above ground, Sir Jeffrey unscrews the lid of a small glass bottle which contains three large capsules. Tipping one out, he stares ahead of himself wide-eyed and afraid and puts the capsule into his mouth. Later, he is writhing on the floor in agony. We can now see that the office in which his dying body is lying is empty of furniture.   POLICE PRESS CONFERENCE. Flanked by a police officer and another man who may be her solicitor or a family member, Sir Jeffrey’s wife is sitting at a table making a statement to the press.  MARGARET PATTERSON (tearfully as she reads from her statement): My husband was a happy man who lived life to the full. He loved his family and his work – and that he should have taken his own life in this way is a mystery and a shock to all who knew him.  (Standing at one side of the room, Helen tries to keep control of her feelings but eventually closes her eyes and lets the tears roll down her face.)   NOVEMBER 26TH. Two boys in their late teens are running down a street at night in the pouring rain. Gary has opened a fold-up umbrella and is trying to keep it under control in the wind, while Jimmy has his jacket pulled up over his head. He calls out in triumph when a black cab approaches with its yellow sign lit to show that it is available for hire.  JIMMY: Yes, yes, taxi, yes!  (He whistles and waves to the taxi but it drives past. He makes an exasperated sound, then starts to head back in the direction he just came, looking round at his friend.)  JIMMY: I’ll be back in two minutes, mate.  GARY: What?  JIMMY: I’m just going home; get my mum’s umbrella.  GARY: You can share mine!  JIMMY: Two minutes, all right?  (He walks away. Some time later Gary looks at his watch, apparently worried because Jimmy has been gone for too long. He turns around and heads back in pursuit of his friend.)   Some unspecified time later, Jimmy sits crying and clutching a small glass bottle which contains three large capsules. He unscrews the lid, his hands shaking, and sobs. We see that he is sitting on a window ledge inside a sports centre overlooking a sports court.   The following day, an article in The Daily Express runs the headline “Boy, 18, kills himself inside sports centre”.   JANUARY 27TH. At a public venue, a party is being held. A large poster showing a photograph of the guest of honour is labelled “Your local MP, Beth Davenport, Junior Minister for Transport.” As pounding dance music comes from inside the room, one of Beth’s aides walks out of the room and goes over to her male colleague who is standing at the bar. He looks at her in exasperation.  AIDE 1: Is she still dancing?  AIDE 2: Yeah, if you can call it that.  AIDE 1: Did you get the car keys off her?  AIDE 2 (showing him the keys): Got ’em out of her bag.  (The man smiles in satisfaction, then looks into the dance hall and frowns.)  AIDE 1: Where is she?   Beth has slipped out of the venue and is standing at the side of her car searching through her handbag for her keys. She sighs when she can’t find them and looks around helplessly.   Some unspecified time later, Beth stands inside a portacabin on a building site and sobs hysterically. As she continues to cry, she reaches out a trembling hand towards a small glass bottle which contains three large capsules.   POLICE PRESS CONFERENCE. Detective Inspector Lestrade sits at the table looking uncomfortable while his colleague sitting beside him, Detective Sergeant Sally Donovan, addresses the gathered press reporters.  DONOVAN: The body of Beth Davenport, Junior Minister for Transport, was found late last night on a building site in Greater London. Preliminary investigations suggest that this was suicide. We can confirm that this apparent suicide closely resembles those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and James Phillimore. In the light of this, these incidents are now being treated as linked. The investigation is ongoing but Detective Inspector Lestrade will take questions now.  REPORTER 1: Detective Inspector, how can suicides be linked?  LESTRADE: Well, they all took the same poison; um, they were all found in places they had no reason to be; none of them had shown any prior indication of ...  REPORTER 1 (interrupting): But you can’t have serial suicides.  LESTRADE: Well, apparently you can.  REPORTER 2: These three people: there’s nothing that links them?  LESTRADE: There’s no link been found yet, but we’re looking for it. There has to be one.  (Everybody’s mobile phone trills a text alert simultaneously. As they look at their phones, each message reads:   Wrong!   Donovan looks at the same message on her own phone.)  DONOVAN: If you’ve all got texts, please ignore them.  REPORTER 1: Just says, ‘Wrong’.  DONOVAN: Yeah, well, just ignore that. Okay, if there are no more questions for Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m going to bring this session to an end.  REPORTER 2: But if they’re suicides, what are you investigating?  LESTRADE: As I say, these ... these suicides are clearly linked. Um, it’s an ... it’s an unusual situation. We’ve got our best people investigating ...  (Everybody’s mobile trills another text alert and again each message reads:   Wrong!   REPORTER 1: Says, ‘Wrong’ again.  (Lestrade looks despairingly at Sally.)  DONOVAN (to the reporters): One more question.  REPORTER 3: Is there any chance that these are murders, and if they are, is this the work of a serial killer?  LESTRADE: I ... I know that you like writing about these, but these do appear to be suicides. We know the difference. The, um, the poison was clearly self-administered.  REPORTER 3: Yes, but if they are murders, how do people keep themselves safe?  LESTRADE: Well, don’t commit suicide.  (The reporter looks at him in shock. Donovan covers her mouth and murmurs a warning.)  DONOVAN: “Daily Mail.”  (Lestrade grimaces and looks at the reporters again.)  LESTRADE: Obviously this is a frightening time for people, but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions. We are all as safe as we want to be.  (Again the mobiles trill their text alerts, and once more each message reads:   Wrong!   But Lestrade’s phone takes a moment longer to alert him to a text and when he looks at it, the message reads:   You know where  to find me.  SH   Looking exasperated, he puts the phone into his pocket and looks at the reporters as he stands up.)  LESTRADE: Thank you.   Shortly afterwards, he and Donovan are walking through the offices of New Scotland Yard.  DONOVAN: You’ve got to stop him doing that. He’s making us look like idiots.  LESTRADE: Well, if you can tell me how he does it, I’ll stop him.   RUSSELL SQUARE PARK. John is limping briskly through the park, leaning heavily on his cane. As he walks past a man sitting on a bench, the man stares after him, clearly recognising him. He calls out.  MIKE: John! John Watson!  (John turns back to Mike as he stands up and hurries towards him, smiling.)  MIKE: Stamford. Mike Stamford. We were at Bart’s together.  JOHN: Yes, sorry, yes, Mike. (He takes Mike’s offered hand and shakes it.) Hello, hi.  MIKE (grinning and gesturing to himself): Yeah, I know. I got fat!  JOHN (trying to sound convincing): No.  MIKE: I heard you were abroad somewhere, getting shot at. What happened?  JOHN (awkwardly): I got shot.  (They both look embarrassed.)   A little later they have bought take-away coffees and are sitting side by side on a bench in the park. Mike looks at John worriedly. Oblivious, John takes a sip from his coffee then looks across to his old colleague.  JOHN: Are you still at Bart’s, then?  MIKE: Teaching now. Bright young things, like we used to be. God, I hate them!  (They both laugh.)  MIKE: What about you? Just staying in town ’til you get yourself sorted?  JOHN: I can’t afford London on an Army pension.  MIKE: Ah, and you couldn’t bear to be anywhere else. That’s not the John Watson I know.  JOHN (uncomfortably): Yeah, I’m not the John Watson ...  (He stops. Mike awkwardly looks away and drinks his coffee. John switches his own cup to his right hand and looks down at his left hand, clenching it into a fist as he tries to control the tremor that has started. Mike looks round at him again.)  MIKE: Couldn’t Harry help?  JOHN (sarcastically): Yeah, like that’s gonna happen!  MIKE (shrugging): I dunno – get a flatshare or something?  JOHN: Come on – who’d want me for a flatmate?  (Mike chuckles thoughtfully.)  JOHN: What?  MIKE: Well, you’re the second person to say that to me today.  JOHN: Who was the first?   ST BARTHOLOMEW’S HOSPITAL MORGUE. Sherlock Holmes unzips the body bag lying on the table and peers at the corpse inside. He sniffs.  SHERLOCK: How fresh?  (Pathologist Molly Hooper walks over.)  MOLLY: Just in. Sixty-seven, natural causes. He used to work here. I knew him. He was nice.  (Zipping up the bag, Sherlock straightens, turns to her and smiles falsely.)  SHERLOCK: Fine. We’ll start with the riding crop.   Shortly afterwards the body has been removed from the bag and is lying on its back on the table. In the observation room next door, Molly watches and flinches while Sherlock flogs the body repeatedly and violently with a riding crop, but her face is also full of admiration. She walks back into the room and as he finishes and straightens up, breathless, she goes over to him.  MOLLY (jokingly): So, bad day, was it?  SHERLOCK (ignoring her banter as he gets out a notebook and starts writing in it): I need to know what bruises form in the next twenty minutes. A man’s alibi depends on it. Text me.  MOLLY: Listen, I was wondering: maybe later, when you’re finished ...  (Sherlock glances across to her as he is writing, then does a double-take and frowns at her.)  SHERLOCK: Are you wearing lipstick? You weren’t wearing lipstick before.  MOLLY (nervously): I, er, I refreshed it a bit.  (She smiles at him flirtatiously. He gives her a long oblivious look, then goes back to writing in his notebook.)  SHERLOCK: Sorry, you were saying?  MOLLY (gazing at him intently): I was wondering if you’d like to have coffee.  (Sherlock puts away his notebook.)  SHERLOCK: Black, two sugars, please. I’ll be upstairs.  (He walks away.)  MOLLY: ... Okay.   BART’S LAB. Sherlock is standing at the far end of the lab using a pipette to squeeze a few drops of liquid onto a Petri dish. Mike knocks on the door and brings John in with him. Sherlock glances across at them briefly before looking at his work again. John limps into the room, looking around at all the equipment.  JOHN: Well, bit different from my day.  MIKE (chuckling): You’ve no idea!  SHERLOCK (sitting down): Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine.  MIKE: And what’s wrong with the landline?  SHERLOCK: I prefer to text.  MIKE: Sorry. It’s in my coat.  (John fishes in his back pocket and takes out his own phone.)  JOHN: Er, here. Use mine.  SHERLOCK: Oh. Thank you.  (Glancing briefly at Mike, he stands up and walks towards John. Mike introduces him.)  MIKE: It’s an old friend of mine, John Watson.  (Sherlock reaches John and takes his phone from him. Turning partially away from him, he flips open the keypad and starts to type on it.)  SHERLOCK: Afghanistan or Iraq?  (John frowns. Nearby, Mike smiles knowingly. John looks at Sherlock as he continues to type.)  JOHN: Sorry?  SHERLOCK: Which was it – Afghanistan or Iraq?  (He briefly raises his eyes to John’s before looking back to the phone. John hesitates, then looks across to Mike, confused. Mike just smiles smugly.)  JOHN: Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you know ...?  (Sherlock looks up as Molly comes into the room holding a mug of coffee.)  SHERLOCK: Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you.  (He shuts down John’s phone and hands it back while Molly brings the mug over to him. He takes it and looks closely at her. Her mouth is paler again.)  SHERLOCK: What happened to the lipstick?  MOLLY (smiling awkwardly at him): It wasn’t working for me.  SHERLOCK: Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth’s too small now.  (He turns and walks back to his station, taking a sip from the mug and grimacing at the taste.)  MOLLY: ... Okay.  (She turns and heads back towards the door.)  SHERLOCK: How do you feel about the violin?  (John looks round at Molly but she’s on her way out the door. He glances at Mike who is still smiling smugly, and finally realises that Sherlock is talking to him.)  JOHN: I’m sorry, what?  SHERLOCK (typing on a laptop keyboard as he talks): I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end. (He looks round at John.) Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.  (He throws a hideously false smile at John, who looks at him blankly for a moment then looks across to Mike.)  JOHN: Oh, you ... you told him about me?  MIKE: Not a word.  JOHN (turning to Sherlock again): Then who said anything about flatmates?  SHERLOCK (picking up his greatcoat and putting it on): I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t that difficult a leap.  JOHN: How did you know about Afghanistan?  (Sherlock ignores the question, wraps his scarf around his neck, then picks up his mobile and checks it.)  SHERLOCK: Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.  (He walks towards John.)  SHERLOCK: We’ll meet there tomorrow evening; seven o’clock. Sorry – gotta dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.  (Putting his phone into the inside pocket of his coat, he walks past John and heads for the door.)  JOHN (turning to look at him): Is that it?  (Sherlock turns back from the door and strolls closer to John again.)  SHERLOCK: Is that what?  JOHN: We’ve only just met and we’re gonna go and look at a flat?  SHERLOCK: Problem?  (John smiles in disbelief, looking across to Mike for help, but his friend just continues to smile as he looks at Sherlock. John turns back to the younger man.)  JOHN: We don’t know a thing about each other; I don’t know where we’re meeting; I don’t even know your name.  (Sherlock looks closely at him for a moment before speaking.)  SHERLOCK: I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid.  (John looks down at his leg and cane and shuffles his feet awkwardly.)  SHERLOCK (smugly): That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?  (He turns and walks to the door again, opening it and going through, but then leans back into the room again.)  SHERLOCK: The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is two two one B Baker Street.  (He click-winks at John, then looks round at Mike.)  SHERLOCK: Afternoon.  (Mike raises a finger in farewell as Sherlock disappears from the room. As the door slams shut behind him, John turns and looks at Mike in disbelief. Mike smiles and nods to him.)  MIKE: Yeah. He’s always like that.   LATER. John has returned to his bedsit. Sitting down on the bed, he takes out his mobile phone and flicks through the menu to find Messages Sent. The last message reads:   If brother has green ladder  arrest brother.  SH   (Puzzled, John looks at the message for a long moment, then looks across to the table where his laptop is lying. He pushes himself to his feet and walks over to the table. Shortly afterwards, he has called up a search website called Quest and types “Sherlock Holmes” into the search box.)   In an unknown location, a woman wearing a pink overcoat and pink high-heeled shoes slowly reaches down with a trembling hand towards a clear glass bottle which is standing on the bare floorboards and which contains three large capsules. Her fingers close around the bottle and she slowly lifts it off the floor, her hand still shaking.   BAKER STREET. John limps along the road and reaches the door marked 221B just as a black cab pulls up at the kerb behind him. John knocks on the door as Sherlock gets out of the cab.  SHERLOCK: Hello.  (He reaches in through the window of the cab and hands some money to the driver.)  SHERLOCK: Thank you.  (John turns towards him as he walks over.)  JOHN: Ah, Mr Holmes.  SHERLOCK: Sherlock, please.  (They shake hands.)  JOHN: Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.  SHERLOCK: Oh, Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she’s giving me a special deal. Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out.  JOHN: Sorry – you stopped her husband being executed?  SHERLOCK: Oh no. I ensured it.  (He smiles at John as the front door is opened by Mrs Hudson, who opens her arms to the younger man.)  MRS HUDSON: Sherlock, hello.  (Sherlock turns and walks into her arms, hugging her briefly, then steps back and presents John to her.)  SHERLOCK: Mrs Hudson, Doctor John Watson.  MRS HUDSON: Hello.  JOHN: How do?  MRS HUDSON (gesturing John inside): Come in.  JOHN: Thank you.  SHERLOCK: Shall we?  MRS HUDSON: Yeah.  (The men go inside and Mrs Hudson closes the door. Sherlock trots up the stairs to the first floor landing, then pauses and waits for John to hobble upstairs. As John reaches the top of the stairs, Sherlock opens the door ahead of him and walks in, revealing the living room of the flat. John follows him in and looks around the room and at all the possessions and boxes scattered around it.)  JOHN: Well, this could be very nice. Very nice indeed.  SHERLOCK: Yes. Yes, I think so. My thoughts precisely.  (He looks around the flat happily.)  SHERLOCK: So I went straight ahead and moved in.  JOHN (simultaneously): Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out ... Oh.  (He pauses, embarrassed, when he realises what Sherlock was saying.)  JOHN: So this is all ...  SHERLOCK: Well, obviously I can, um, straighten things up a bit.  (He walks across the room and makes a half-hearted attempt to tidy up a little, throwing a couple of folders into a box and then taking some apparently unopened envelopes across to the fireplace where he puts them onto the mantelpiece and then stabs a multi tool knife into them. John has noticed something else on the mantelpiece and lifts his cane to point at it.)  JOHN: That’s a skull.  SHERLOCK: Friend of mine. When I say ‘friend’ ...  (Mrs Hudson has followed them into the room. She picks up a cup and saucer while Sherlock takes off his greatcoat and scarf.)  MRS HUDSON: What do you think, then, Doctor Watson? There’s another bedroom upstairs if you’ll be needing two bedrooms.  JOHN: Of course we’ll be needing two.  MRS HUDSON: Oh, don’t worry; there’s all sorts round here. (Confidentially, dropping her voice to a whisper by the end of the sentence) Mrs Turner next door’s got married ones.  (John looks across to Sherlock, expecting him to confirm that he and John are not involved in that way but Sherlock appears oblivious to what’s being insinuated. Mrs Hudson walks across to the kitchen, then turns back and frowns at Sherlock.)  MRS HUDSON: Oh, Sherlock. The mess you’ve made.  (She goes into the kitchen and starts tidying up, and John walks over to one of the two armchairs, plumps up a cushion on the chair and then drops heavily down into it. He looks across to Sherlock who is still tidying up a little.)  JOHN: I looked you up on the internet last night.  SHERLOCK (turning around to him): Anything interesting?  JOHN: Found your website, The Science of Deduction.  SHERLOCK (smiling proudly): What did you think?  (John throws him a “you have got to be kidding me” type of look. Sherlock looks hurt.)  JOHN: You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb.  SHERLOCK: Yes; and I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother’s drinking habits in your mobile phone.  JOHN: How?  (Sherlock smiles and turns away. Mrs Hudson comes out of the kitchen reading a newspaper.)  MRS HUDSON: What about these suicides then, Sherlock? I thought that’d be right up your street. Three exactly the same.  (Sherlock walks over to the window of the living room at the sound of a car pulling up outside.)  SHERLOCK: Four.  (He looks down at the car as someone gets out of it. The vehicle is a police car with its lights flashing on the roof.)  SHERLOCK: There’s been a fourth. And there’s something different this time.  MRS HUDSON: A fourth?  (Sherlock turns as D.I. Lestrade [who apparently must have picked the lock on the front door ... like you do ...] trots up the stairs and comes into the living room.)  SHERLOCK: Where?  LESTRADE: Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.  SHERLOCK: What’s new about this one? You wouldn’t have come to get me if there wasn’t something different.  LESTRADE: You know how they never leave notes?  SHERLOCK: Yeah.  LESTRADE: This one did. Will you come?  SHERLOCK: Who’s on forensics?  LESTRADE: It’s Anderson.  SHERLOCK (grimacing): Anderson won’t work with me.  LESTRADE: Well, he won’t be your assistant.  SHERLOCK: I need an assistant.  LESTRADE: Will you come?  SHERLOCK: Not in a police car. I’ll be right behind.  LESTRADE: Thank you.  (Looking round at John and Mrs Hudson for a moment, he turns and hurries off down the stairs. Sherlock waits until he has reached the front door, then leaps into the air and clenches his fists triumphantly before twirling around the room happily.)  SHERLOCK: Brilliant! Yes! Ah, four serial suicides, and now a note! Oh, it’s Christmas!  (Picking up his scarf and coat he starts to put them on while heading for the kitchen.)  SHERLOCK: Mrs Hudson, I’ll be late. Might need some food.  MRS HUDSON: I’m your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper.  SHERLOCK: Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home. Don’t wait up!  (Grabbing a small leather pouch from the kitchen table, he opens the kitchen door and disappears from view. Mrs Hudson turns back to John.)  MRS HUDSON: Look at him, dashing about! My husband was just the same.  (John grimaces at her repeated implication that he and Sherlock are an item.)  MRS HUDSON: But you’re more the sitting-down type, I can tell.  (John looks uncomfortable.)  MRS HUDSON (turning towards the door): I’ll make you that cuppa. You rest your leg.  JOHN (loudly): Damn my leg!  (His response was instinctive and he is immediately apologetic even as Mrs Hudson turns back to him in shock.)  JOHN: Sorry, I’m so sorry. It’s just sometimes this bloody thing ...  (He bashes his leg with his cane.)  MRS HUDSON: I understand, dear; I’ve got a hip.  (She turns towards the door again.)  JOHN: Cup of tea’d be lovely, thank you.  MRS HUDSON: Just this once, dear. I’m not your housekeeper.  JOHN: Couple of biscuits too, if you’ve got ’em.  MRS HUDSON: Not your housekeeper!  (John has picked up the newspaper which Mrs Hudson put down and now he looks at the article reporting Beth Davenport’s apparent suicide. Next to a large photograph of Beth is a smaller one showing the man who just visited the flat and identifying him as D.I. Lestrade. Before he can read on, Sherlock’s voice interrupts him and John looks up and sees him standing at the living room door.)  SHERLOCK: You’re a doctor. In fact you’re an Army doctor.  JOHN: Yes.  (He gets to his feet and turns towards Sherlock as he comes back into the room again.)  SHERLOCK: Any good?  JOHN: Very good.  SHERLOCK: Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths.  JOHN: Mmm, yes.  SHERLOCK: Bit of trouble too, I bet.  JOHN (quietly): Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.  SHERLOCK: Wanna see some more?  JOHN (fervently): Oh God, yes.  (Sherlock spins on his heel and leads John out of the room and down the stairs. John calls out as he follows him down.)  JOHN: Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I’ll skip the tea. Off out.  MRS HUDSON (standing near the bottom of the stairs): Both of you?  (Sherlock has almost reached the front door but now turns and walks back towards her.)  SHERLOCK: Impossible suicides? Four of them? There’s no point sitting at home when there’s finally something fun going on!  (He takes her by the shoulders and kisses her noisily on the cheek.)  MRS HUDSON: Look at you, all happy. It’s not decent.  (She can’t help but smile, though, as he turns away and heads for the front door again.)  SHERLOCK: Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!  (He walks out onto the street and hails an approaching black cab.)  SHERLOCK: Taxi!  (The taxi pulls up alongside and he and John get in, then the car drives off again and heads for Brixton. The boys sit in silence for a long time while Sherlock sits with his eyes fixed on his smartphone and John keeps stealing nervous glances at him. Finally Sherlock lowers his phone.)  SHERLOCK: Okay, you’ve got questions.  JOHN: Yeah, where are we going?  SHERLOCK: Crime scene. Next?  JOHN: Who are you? What do you do?  SHERLOCK: What do you think?  JOHN (slowly, hesitantly): I’d say private detective ...  SHERLOCK: But?  JOHN: ... but the police don’t go to private detectives.  SHERLOCK: I’m a consulting detective. Only one in the world. I invented the job.  JOHN: What does that mean?  SHERLOCK: It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me.  JOHN: The police don’t consult amateurs.  (Sherlock throws him a look.)  SHERLOCK: When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said, “Afghanistan or Iraq?” You looked surprised.  JOHN: Yes, how did you know?  SHERLOCK: I didn’t know, I saw. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. But your conversation as you entered the room ...  (Flashback to the lab at Bart’s)  JOHN (looking around the lab): Bit different from my day.  SHERLOCK: ... said trained at Bart’s, so Army doctor – obvious. Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. Your limp’s really bad when you walk but you don’t ask for a chair when you stand, like you’ve forgotten about it, so it’s at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan – Afghanistan or Iraq.  (He loudly clicks the ‘k’ sound at the end of the final word. Your humble transcriber, for whom this is her favourite vocal idiosyncrasy from Sherlock, giggles quietly.)  JOHN: You said I had a therapist.  SHERLOCK: You’ve got a psychosomatic limp – of course you’ve got a therapist. Then there’s your brother.  JOHN: Hmm?  SHERLOCK (holding out his hand): Your phone. It’s expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you’re looking for a flatshare – you wouldn’t waste money on this. It’s a gift, then.  (By now John has given him the phone and he turns it over and looks at it again as he talks.)  SHERLOCK: Scratches. Not one, many over time. It’s been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting next to me wouldn’t treat his one luxury item like this, so it’s had a previous owner. Next bit’s easy. You know it already.  JOHN: The engraving.  (We see that engraved on the back of the phone are the words   Harry Watson  From Clara  xxx   SHERLOCK: Harry Watson: clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone. Not your father; this is a young man’s gadget. Could be a cousin, but you’re a war hero who can’t find a place to live. Unlikely you’ve got an extended family, certainly not one you’re close to, so brother it is. Now, Clara. Who’s Clara? Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him recently – this model’s only six months old. Marriage in trouble then – six months on he’s just given it away. If she’d left him, he’d have kept it. People do – sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you: that says he wants you to stay in touch. You’re looking for cheap accommodation, but you’re not going to your brother for help: that says you’ve got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you don’t like his drinking.  JOHN: How can you possibly know about the drinking?  SHERLOCK (smiling): Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them.  (He hands the phone back.)  SHERLOCK: There you go, you see – you were right.  JOHN: I was right? Right about what?  SHERLOCK: The police don’t consult amateurs.  (He looks out of the side window, biting his lip nervously while he awaits John’s reaction.)  JOHN: That ... was amazing.  (Sherlock looks round, apparently so surprised that he can’t even reply for the next four seconds.)  SHERLOCK: Do you think so?  JOHN: Of course it was. It was extraordinary; it was quite extraordinary.  SHERLOCK: That’s not what people normally say.  JOHN: What do people normally say?  SHERLOCK: ‘Piss off’!  (He smiles briefly at John, who grins and turns away to look out of the window as the journey continues.)   BRIXTON. The cab has arrived at Lauriston Gardens and Sherlock and John get out and walk towards the police tape strung across the road.  SHERLOCK: Did I get anything wrong?  JOHN: Harry and me don’t get on, never have. Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they’re getting a divorce; and Harry is a drinker.  SHERLOCK (looking impressed with himself): Spot on, then. I didn’t expect to be right about everything.  JOHN: And Harry’s short for Harriet.  (Sherlock stops dead in his tracks.)  SHERLOCK: Harry’s your sister.  JOHN (continuing onwards): Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?  SHERLOCK (furiously, through gritted teeth): Sister!  JOHN: No, seriously, what am I doing here?  SHERLOCK (exasperated, starting to walk again): There’s always something.  (They approach the police tape where they are met by Sergeant Donovan.)  DONOVAN: Hello, freak.  SHERLOCK: I’m here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade.  DONOVAN: Why?  SHERLOCK: I was invited.  DONOVAN: Why?  SHERLOCK (sarcastically): I think he wants me to take a look.  DONOVAN: Well, you know what I think, don’t you?  SHERLOCK (lifting the tape and ducking underneath it): Always, Sally. (He breathes in through his nose.) I even know you didn’t make it home last night.  DONOVAN: I don’t ... (She looks at John.) Er, who’s this?  SHERLOCK: Colleague of mine, Doctor Watson.  (He turns to John.)  SHERLOCK: Doctor Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan. (His voice drips with sarcasm.) Old friend.  DONOVAN: A colleague? How do you get a colleague?!  (She turns to John.)  DONOVAN: What, did he follow you home?  JOHN: Would it be better if I just waited and ...  SHERLOCK (lifting the tape for him): No.  (As John walks under the tape, Donovan lifts a radio to her mouth.)  DONOVAN (into radio): Freak’s here. Bringing him in.  (She leads the boys towards one of the houses. Sherlock looks all around the area and at the ground as they approach. As they reach the pavement, a man wearing a coverall over his clothes comes out of the house.)  SHERLOCK: Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.  (Anderson looks at him with distaste.)  ANDERSON: It’s a crime scene. I don’t want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?  SHERLOCK (taking in another deep breath through his nose): Quite clear. And is your wife away for long?  ANDERSON: Oh, don’t pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that.  SHERLOCK: Your deodorant told me that.  ANDERSON: My deodorant?  SHERLOCK (with a quirky expression on his face): It’s for men.  ANDERSON: Well, of course it’s for men! I’m wearing it!  SHERLOCK: So’s Sergeant Donovan.  (Anderson looks round in shock at Donovan. Sherlock sniffs pointedly.)  SHERLOCK: Ooh, and I think it just vaporised. May I go in?  ANDERSON (turning back and pointing at him angrily): Now look: whatever you’re trying to imply ...  SHERLOCK: I’m not implying anything.  (He heads past Donovan towards the front door.)  SHERLOCK: I’m sure Sally came round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over.  (He turns back.)  SHERLOCK: And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.  (Anderson and Donovan stare at him in horror. He smiles smugly, then turns and goes into the house. John walks past Sally, briefly but pointedly looking down to her knees, then follows Sherlock inside. Sherlock leads him into a room on the ground floor where Lestrade is putting on a coverall. Sherlock points to a pile of similar items.)  SHERLOCK (to John): You need to wear one of these.  LESTRADE: Who’s this?  SHERLOCK (taking off his gloves): He’s with me.  LESTRADE: But who is he?  SHERLOCK: I said he’s with me.  (John has taken off his jacket and picks up a coverall. He looks at Sherlock who has picked up a pair of latex gloves.)  JOHN (referring to the coverall): Aren’t you gonna put one on?  (Sherlock just looks at him sternly. John shakes his head as if to say, ‘Silly me. What was I thinking?!’)  SHERLOCK (to Lestrade): So where are we?  LESTRADE (picking up another pair of latex gloves): Upstairs."
  LESTRADE," I can give you two minutes.  SHERLOCK (casually): May need longer.  LESTRADE: Her name’s Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards. We’re running them now for contact details. Hasn’t been here long. Some kids found her.  (He leads them into a room two storeys above the ground floor. The room is empty of furniture except for a rocking horse in the far corner. Emergency portable lighting has been set up, presumably by the police. Scaffolding poles hold up part of the ceiling near where a couple of large holes have been knocked through one of the walls. A woman’s body is lying face down on the bare floorboards in the middle of the room. She is wearing a bright pink overcoat and high-heeled pink shoes. Her hands are flat on the floor either side of her head. Sherlock walks a few steps into the room and then stops, holding one hand out in front of himself as he focuses on the corpse. Behind him, John looks at the woman’s body and his face fills with pain and sadness. The three of them stand there silently for several long seconds, then Sherlock looks across to Lestrade.)  SHERLOCK: Shut up.  LESTRADE (startled): I didn’t say anything.  SHERLOCK: You were thinking. It’s annoying.  (Lestrade and John exchange a surprised look as Sherlock steps slowly forward until he reaches the side of the corpse. His attention is immediately drawn to the fact that scratched into the floorboards near the woman’s left hand is the word “Rache”. His eyes flick to her fingernails where the index and middle nails are broken and ragged at the ends, the pink nail polish chipped in stark comparison to her other nails which are still immaculate. The woman’s index finger rests at the bottom of the ‘e’ as if she was still trying to carve into the floor when she died. Sherlock makes an instant deduction:   left handed   He looks back to the word carved into the floorboards and an immediate suggestion springs into his mind:   RACHE  German (n.) revenge   Instantly he shakes his head in a tiny dismissive movement and the suggestion disappears. He looks at the carved word again and overlays the five letters with a clearer type. Next to the ‘e’ a rapid progression of letters appear and disappear as he tries to complete the word, then the correct letter settles into place to form the word:   Rachel   He squats down beside the body and runs his gloved hand along the back of her coat, then lifts his hand again to look at his fingers:   wet   He reaches into her coat pockets and finds a white folding umbrella in one of them. Running his fingers along the folds of the material, he then inspects his glove again:   dry   Putting the umbrella back into her pocket, he moves up to the collar of her coat and runs his fingers underneath it before again looking at his fingers:   wet   Reaching into his pocket he takes out a small magnifier, clicks it open and closely inspects the delicate gold bracelet on her left wrist ...   clean   ... then the gold earring attached to her right ear ...   clean   ... and then the gold chain around her neck ...   clean   ... before moving on to look at the rings on her left ring finger. The wedding ring and engagement ring flag a different message to him:   dirty   Sherlock blinks as a rapid succession of conclusions appear in front of his eyes:   married  unhappily married  unhappily married 10+ years   Carefully Sherlock works the wedding ring off the woman’s finger and holds it up to look at the inside of the ring. While the outside of the ring is still showing   dirty   the inside registers as   clean   As Sherlock lowers the ring and slides it back onto the woman’s finger, he has already reached a conclusion about the ring:   regularly removed   Lifting his hands away from the woman, he looks down at her and makes his final deduction about her:   serial adulterer   He smiles slightly in satisfaction.)  LESTRADE: Got anything?  SHERLOCK (nonchalantly): Not much.  (Standing up, he takes off the gloves and then gets his mobile phone from his pocket and begins typing on it.)  ANDERSON (from where he is leaning casually against the doorway): She’s German. ‘Rache’: it’s German for ‘revenge.’ She could be trying to tell us something ...  (While he was speaking, Sherlock has walked quickly towards the door and now begins to close it in Anderson’s face.)  SHERLOCK (sarcastically): Yes, thank you for your input.  (Slamming the door shut, he turns and walks back into the room. On his phone, he has called up a menu for “UK Weather”. The menu offers five options:   Maps  Local  Warnings  Next 24 hrs  7 day forecast   He selects the Maps option.)  LESTRADE: So she’s German?  SHERLOCK (still looking at his phone): Of course she’s not. She’s from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night ... (he smiles smugly when he apparently finds the information he needed) ... before returning home to Cardiff.  (He pockets his phone.)  SHERLOCK: So far, so obvious.  JOHN: Sorry – obvious?  LESTRADE: What about the message, though?  SHERLOCK (ignoring him and looking at John): Doctor Watson, what do you think?  JOHN: Of the message?  SHERLOCK: Of the body. You’re a medical man.  LESTRADE: Wait, no, we have a whole team right outside.  SHERLOCK: They won’t work with me.  LESTRADE: I’m breaking every rule letting you in here.  SHERLOCK: Yes ... because you need me.  (Lestrade stares at him for a moment, then lowers his eyes helplessly.)  LESTRADE: Yes, I do. God help me.  SHERLOCK: Doctor Watson.  JOHN: Hm?  (He looks up from the body to Sherlock and then turns his head towards Lestrade, silently seeking his permission.)  LESTRADE (a little tetchily): Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.  (He turns and opens the door, going outside.)  LESTRADE: Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes.  (Sherlock and John walk over to the body. Sherlock squats down on one side of it and John painfully lowers himself to one knee on the other side, leaning heavily on his cane to support himself.)  SHERLOCK: Well?  JOHN (softly): What am I doing here?  SHERLOCK (softly): Helping me make a point.  JOHN (softly): I’m supposed to be helping you pay the rent.  SHERLOCK (softly): Yeah, well, this is more fun.  JOHN: Fun? There’s a woman lying dead.  SHERLOCK: Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you’d go deeper.  ( Lestrade comes back into the room and stands just inside the doorway, and John drags his other leg down into a kneeling position and then leans forward to look more closely at the woman’s body. He puts his head close to hers and sniffs, then straightens a little before lifting her right hand and looking at the skin. He kneels up and looks across to Sherlock.)  JOHN: Yeah ... Asphyxiation, probably. Passed out, choked on her own vomit. Can’t smell any alcohol on her. It could have been a seizure; possibly drugs.  SHERLOCK: You know what it was. You’ve read the papers.  JOHN: What, she’s one of the suicides? The fourth ...?  LESTRADE: Sherlock – two minutes, I said. I need anything you’ve got.  SHERLOCK (standing up, while John struggles to get to his feet): Victim is in her late thirties. Professional person, going by her clothes; I’m guessing something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink. Travelled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night. It’s obvious from the size of her suitcase.  LESTRADE: Suitcase?  (John looks around the room but can’t see a suitcase anywhere.)  SHERLOCK: Suitcase, yes. She’s been married at least ten years, but not happily. She’s had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married.  LESTRADE: Oh, for God’s sake, if you’re just making this up ...  SHERLOCK (pointing down to her left hand): Her wedding ring. Ten years old at least. The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring. State of her marriage right there. The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside – that means it’s regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. It’s not for work; look at her nails. She doesn’t work with her hands, so what or rather who does she remove her rings for? Clearly not one lover; she’d never sustain the fiction of being single over that amount of time, so more likely a string of them. Simple.  JOHN (admiringly): That’s brilliant.  (Sherlock looks round at him.)  JOHN: Sorry.  LESTRADE: Cardiff?  SHERLOCK: It’s obvious, isn’t it?  JOHN: It’s not obvious to me.  SHERLOCK (pausing as he looks at the other two): Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring.  (He turns back to the body.)  SHERLOCK: Her coat: it’s slightly damp. She’s been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London in that time. Under her coat collar is damp, too. She’s turned it up against the wind. She’s got an umbrella in her left-hand pocket but it’s dry and unused: not just wind, strong wind – too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight, so she must have come a decent distance but she can’t have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn’t dried. So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?  (He gets his phone from his pocket and shows to the other two the webpage he was looking at earlier, displaying today’s weather for the southern part of Britain.)  SHERLOCK: Cardiff.  JOHN: That’s fantastic!  SHERLOCK (turning to him and speaking in a low voice): D’you know you do that out loud?  JOHN: Sorry. I’ll shut up.  SHERLOCK: No, it’s ... fine.  LESTRADE: Why d’you keep saying suitcase?  SHERLOCK (spinning around in a circle to look around the room): Yes, where is it? She must have had a phone or an organiser. Find out who Rachel is.  LESTRADE: She was writing ‘Rachel’?  SHERLOCK (sarcastically): No, she was leaving an angry note in German(!) Of course she was writing Rachel; no other word it can be. Question is: why did she wait until she was dying to write it?  LESTRADE: How d’you know she had a suitcase?  SHERLOCK (pointing down to the body, where her tights have small black splotches on the lower part of her right leg): Back of the right leg: tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don’t get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, going by the spread. Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious: could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying one night.  (He squats down by the woman’s body and examines the backs of her legs more closely.)  SHERLOCK: Now, where is it? What have you done with it?  LESTRADE: There wasn’t a case.  (Slowly Sherlock raises his head and frowns up at Lestrade.)  SHERLOCK: Say that again.  LESTRADE: There wasn’t a case. There was never any suitcase.  (Immediately Sherlock straightens up and heads for the door, calling out to all the police officers in the house as he begins to hurry down the stairs.)  SHERLOCK: Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house?  (Lestrade and John follow him out and stop on the landing. Lestrade calls down the stairs.)  LESTRADE: Sherlock, there was no case!  SHERLOCK (slowing down, but still making his way down the stairs): But they take the poison themselves; they chew, swallow the pills themselves. There are clear signs. Even you lot couldn’t miss them.  LESTRADE: Right, yeah, thanks(!) And ...?  SHERLOCK: It’s murder, all of them. I don’t know how, but they’re not suicides, they’re killings – serial killings.  (He holds his hands up in front of his face in delight.)  SHERLOCK: We’ve got ourselves a serial killer. I love those. There’s always something to look forward to.  LESTRADE: Why are you saying that?  SHERLOCK (stopping and calling up to the others): Her case! Come on, where is her case? Did she eat it?(!) Someone else was here, and they took her case. (More quietly, as if talking to himself) So the killer must have driven her here; forgot the case was in the car.  JOHN: She could have checked into a hotel, left her case there.  SHERLOCK (looking up the stairs again): No, she never got to the hotel. Look at her hair. She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. She’d never have left any hotel with her hair still looking ...  (He stops talking as he makes a realisation.)  SHERLOCK: Oh.  (His eyes widen and his face lights up.)  SHERLOCK: Oh!  (He claps his hands together in delight.)  JOHN: Sherlock?  LESTRADE (leaning over the railings): What is it, what?  SHERLOCK (smiling cheerfully to himself): Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake.  LESTRADE: We can’t just wait!  SHERLOCK: Oh, we’re done waiting!  (He starts to hurry down the stairs again.)  SHERLOCK: Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff: find out who Jennifer Wilson’s family and friends were. Find Rachel!  (He reaches the bottom of the stairs and disappears from view.)  LESTRADE (calling after him): Of course, yeah – but what mistake?!  (Sherlock comes back into view and runs up a couple of stairs so that he can be seen before he stops and yells up to Lestrade.)  SHERLOCK: PINK!  (He hurries off again. Lestrade, baffled, turns and goes back into the room while Anderson and his team, who had been waiting on the next landing down, hurry up the stairs and follow him into the room.)  ANDERSON: Let’s get on with it.  (Forgotten by everyone else, John hesitates on the landing for a moment and then slowly starts making his way down the stairs. A couple more police officers hurry up and one of them bumps against him, throwing him off-balance and making him lurch heavily against the bannisters. The man hurries on without a word, although his colleague does at least look apologetically at John as he passes. John regains his balance and continues down the stairs.  Shortly afterwards he has removed his coverall and put his jacket back on, and now walks out onto the street. Looking all around, he can see no sign of Sherlock. He walks towards the police tape, still looking around. Donovan, standing at the tape, sees him.)  DONOVAN: He’s gone.  JOHN: Who, Sherlock Holmes?  DONOVAN: Yeah, he just took off. He does that.  JOHN: Is he coming back?  DONOVAN: Didn’t look like it.  JOHN: Right.  (He looks around the area again thoughtfully, unsure what to do.)  JOHN: Right ... Yes.  (He turns to Donovan again.)  JOHN: Sorry, where am I?  DONOVAN: Brixton.  JOHN: Right. Er, d’you know where I could get a cab? It’s just, er ... well ... (he looks down awkwardly at his walking stick) ... my leg.  DONOVAN: Er ... (she steps over to the tape and lifts it for him) ... try the main road.  JOHN (ducking under the tape): Thanks.  DONOVAN: But you’re not his friend.  (John turns back towards her.)  DONOVAN: He doesn’t have friends. So who are you?  JOHN: I’m ... I’m nobody. I just met him.  DONOVAN: Okay, bit of advice then: stay away from that guy.  JOHN: Why?  DONOVAN: You know why he’s here? He’s not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it. The weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what? One day just showing up won’t be enough. One day we’ll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes’ll be the one that put it there.  JOHN: Why would he do that?  DONOVAN: Because he’s a psychopath. And psychopaths get bored.  LESTRADE (calling from the entrance to the house): Donovan!  DONOVAN (turning and calling to him): Coming.  (She turns back towards John as she walks towards the house.)  DONOVAN: Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.  (John watches her go for a moment, then turns and begins to limp off down the road. To his right, the phone in a public telephone box begins to ring. He stops and looks at it for a few seconds but then looks down at his watch, shakes his head and continues down the road. The phone stops ringing.)   Not long afterwards, John is walking down what may well be Brixton High Road. He tries to hail a passing taxi.  JOHN: Taxi! Taxi ...  (The taxi passes him by. In Chicken Cottage, the fast food restaurant outside which John is standing, the payphone on the wall begins to ring. John turns and looks as one of the serving staff walks over to it but as he reaches for the phone, it stops. John walks on down the road and shortly afterwards approaches another public telephone box. The phone inside starts to ring. Mystified by this, he pulls open the door, goes inside and lifts the phone.)  JOHN: Hello?  (A man’s voice speaks down the phone.)  MAN’s VOICE: There is a security camera on the building to your left. Do you see it?  JOHN (frowning): Who’s this? Who’s speaking?  MAN’s VOICE: Do you see the camera, Doctor Watson?  (John looks through the window of the phone box at the CCTV camera high up on the wall of a nearby building.)  JOHN: Yeah, I see it.  MAN’s VOICE: Watch.  (The camera, which was pointing directly at the phone box, now swivels away.)  MAN’s VOICE: There is another camera on the building opposite you. Do you see it?  (John looks across to the second camera, which is also pointed towards the phone box.)  JOHN: Mm-hm.  (The camera immediately swivels away.)  MAN’s VOICE: And finally, at the top of the building on your right.  (John stares up into the third camera which is watching him but which now turns away.)  JOHN (into phone): How are you doing this?  MAN’s VOICE: Get into the car, Doctor Watson.  (A black car pulls up at the kerbside near the phone. The male driver gets out and opens the rear door.)  MAN’s VOICE: I would make some sort of threat, but I’m sure your situation is quite clear to you.  (The phone goes dead. John puts it down and looks thoughtful for a long moment, then apparently decides that there’s not much else he can do and turns to leave the phone box.)   A few moments later he is sitting in the back seat of the car as it pulls away and drives off. An attractive young woman is sitting beside him, her eyes fixed on her BlackBerry while she types on it. She is pretty much ignoring him.  JOHN: Hello.  WOMAN (smiling brightly at him for a moment before returning her gaze to her phone): Hi.  JOHN: What’s your name, then?  WOMAN: Er ... Anthea.  JOHN: Is that your real name?  WOMAN (smiling): No.  (John nods, then twists to look out of the rear window briefly before turning back again.)  JOHN: I’m John.  NOT-ANTHEA: Yes. I know.  JOHN: Any point in asking where I’m going?  NOT-ANTHEA: None at all ...  (She turns and smiles briefly at him, then looks back at her phone again.)  NOT-ANTHEA: ... John.  JOHN: Okay.   Some time later, the car pulls into an almost-empty warehouse. A man in a suit is standing in the centre of the area, leaning nonchalantly on an umbrella while he watches the car stop and John get out.  [Transcriber’s note: Now, I know that the vast majority of people who read this transcript will have already seen the episode, but for the benefit of the very few people who may be reading this having never watched the show, and because at this point in the episode we are not told who this person is, I’m going to refer to him as ‘M’, which is short for ... um, ‘Man,’ okay? {transcriber inserts winky face here...}]  In front of the man is a straight-backed armless chair facing him. He gestures to it with the point of his umbrella as John limps towards him leaning heavily on his cane.  M: Have a seat, John.  (John continues towards him, his voice calm.)  JOHN: You know, I’ve got a phone.  (He looks round the warehouse.)  JOHN: I mean, very clever and all that, but, er ... you could just phone me. On my phone.  (He walks straight past the chair and stops a few paces in front of the man.)  M: When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes, one learns to be discreet, hence this place.  (His voice, which has had a pleasant smile in it so far, now becomes a little more stern towards the end of the next phrase.)  M: The leg must be hurting you. Sit down.  JOHN: I don’t wanna sit down.  (The man looks at him curiously.)  M: You don’t seem very afraid.  JOHN: You don’t seem very frightening.  (The man chuckles.)  M: Ah, yes. The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t you think?  (He looks at John sternly.)  M: What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?  JOHN: I don’t have one. I barely know him. I met him ...  (He looks away thoughtfully, then appears surprised as if he hadn’t realised until now how little time has passed.)  JOHN: ... yesterday.  M: Mm, and since yesterday you’ve moved in with him and now you’re solving crimes together. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?  JOHN: Who are you?  M: An interested party.  JOHN: Interested in Sherlock? Why? I’m guessing you’re not friends.  M: You’ve met him. How many ‘friends’ do you imagine he has? I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.  JOHN: And what’s that?  M: An enemy.  JOHN: An enemy?  M: In his mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, he’d probably say his arch-enemy. He does love to be dramatic.  (John looks pointedly around the warehouse.)  JOHN (sarcastically): Well, thank God you’re above all that.  (The man frowns at him. Just then John’s phone trills a text alert. He immediately digs into his jacket pocket, takes out the phone and activates it, looking at the message while ignoring the man in front of him. The message reads:   Baker Street.  Come at once  if convenient.  SH   M: I hope I’m not distracting you.  JOHN (casually): Not distracting me at all.  (He takes his time looking up from the phone before he pockets it.)  M: Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?  JOHN: I could be wrong, but I think that’s none of your business.  M (a little ominously): It could be.  JOHN: It really couldn’t.  (The man takes a notebook from his inside pocket, then opens it and consults it as he speaks.)  M: If you do move into, um ... two hundred and twenty-one B Baker Street, I’d be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.  (He closes the notebook and puts it away again.)  JOHN: Why?  M: Because you’re not a wealthy man.  JOHN: In exchange for what?  M: Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel ... uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to.  JOHN: Why?  M: I worry about him. Constantly.  JOHN (insincerely): That’s nice of you.  M: But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned. We have what you might call a ... difficult relationship.  (John’s phone sounds another text alert. Again he immediately fishes the phone out and looks at the message which reads:   If inconvenient,  come anyway.  SH   JOHN (in response to the man’s offer): No.  M: But I haven’t mentioned a figure.  JOHN (putting his phone away again): Don’t bother.  M (laughing briefly): You’re very loyal, very quickly.  JOHN: No, I’m not. I’m just not interested.  (The man looks at him closely for a moment, then takes out his notebook and opens it again.)  M (gesturing slightly to make it clear that he is reading a note from the book): “Trust issues,” it says here.  (For the first time since their encounter began, John looks a little unnerved.)  JOHN: What’s that?  M (still looking down at his book): Could it be that you’ve decided to trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?  JOHN: Who says I trust him?  M: You don’t seem the kind to make friends easily.  JOHN: Are we done?  (The man raises his head and looks into John’s eyes.)  M: You tell me.  (John looks at him for a long moment, then turns his back on him and starts to walk away.)  M: I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him, but I can see from your left hand that’s not going to happen.  (John stops dead. His shoulders tense and drop and he angrily shakes his head a little. He is clearly furious as he turns back around to face the man.)  JOHN (savagely, through bared teeth): My wot?  M (calmly): Show me.  (He has nodded towards John’s left hand as he speaks, and now he plants the tip of his umbrella on the floor and leans casually on it like a man who is used to having his orders obeyed. John, however, is not going to be intimidated and deliberately shifts his feet under him as if digging in. He raises his left hand, bending it at the elbow, and stands still. His message is clear: if the man wants to look at his hand, he’ll have to come to him. Apparently unperturbed by this belligerence, the man strolls forward, hooking the handle of the umbrella over his arm as he reaches for John’s hand. John instantly pulls his hand back a little.)  JOHN (tensely): Don’t.  (The man lowers his head and raises his eyebrows at John, almost as if saying, ‘Did I mention trust issues?!’ John very reluctantly lowers his hand, holding it out flat with the palm down. The man takes it in both of his own hands and looks at it closely.)  M: Remarkable.  JOHN (snatching his hand away): What is?  M (turning and walking a few paces away): Most people blunder round this city, and all they see are streets and shops and cars. When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield. (He turns towards John again.) You’ve seen it already, haven’t you?  JOHN: What’s wrong with my hand?  M: You have an intermittent tremor in your left hand.  (Perhaps unintentionally, John nods his head.)  M: Your therapist thinks it’s post-traumatic stress disorder. She thinks you’re haunted by memories of your military service.  (John almost flinches as the man accurately fires off these facts at him. His gaze is fixed ahead of him and a muscle in his cheek twitches repeatedly.)  JOHN (angry and distressed): Who the hell are you? How do you know that?  M: Fire her. She’s got it the wrong way round. You’re under stress right now and your hand is perfectly steady.  (John’s eyes flicker downwards before returning to stare ahead of himself, his face set and struggling to hold back his anger.)  M: You’re not haunted by the war, Doctor Watson. You miss it.  (He leans closer to him. Reluctantly John’s eyes rise up to meet his.)  M (in a whisper): Welcome back.  (He turns and starts to walk away just as John’s phone trills another text alert.)  M (casually twirling his umbrella as he goes): Time to choose a side, Doctor Watson.  (John stands fixed to the spot for a few seconds, then turns and glances towards the departing man while, behind John, the car door opens and not-Anthea gets out and walks a few paces towards him, her attention still riveted to the BlackBerry held in front of her in both hands.)  NOT-ANTHEA: I’m to take you home.  (John half-turns towards her, then stops and takes out his phone to look at the new message. It reads:   Could be dangerous.  SH   Putting the phone back into his pocket, John holds out his left hand in front of him and studies the lack of tremor coming from it. He smiles wryly.)  NOT-ANTHEA: Address?  JOHN (turning and walking towards her): Er, Baker Street. Two two one B Baker Street. But I need to stop off somewhere first.   Later, John opens the door into his bedsit and switches on the light. Walking inside and closing the door behind him, he goes across to the desk and opens the drawer, taking out his pistol. Checking the clip, he tucks the gun into the back of the waistband of his jeans and turns to leave again.   Later again, the car pulls up outside 221B Baker Street. Not-Anthea is still rivetted by whatever she’s typing on her phone [that must be one heck of a running blog that she’s writing]. John looks across to her.  JOHN: Listen, your boss – any chance you could not tell him this is where I went?  NOT-ANTHEA (nonchalantly): Sure.  JOHN: You’ve told him already, haven’t you?  (She smiles across to him briefly.)  NOT-ANTHEA: Yeah.  (John nods in resignation and turns to get out of the car but just as he has opened the door, he turns back to her.)  JOHN: Hey, um ... do you ever get any free time?  (She chuckles.)  NOT-ANTHEA (sarcastically) : Oh, yeah. Lots.  (John waits expectantly. She continues working her phone for a long moment, then turns and looks at him before allowing her gaze to drift past him to the door of 221B.)  NOT-ANTHEA: ’Bye.  JOHN: Okay.  (He gets out and closes the door, then watches the car pull away before turning and walking across the pavement to the front door of 221B. He knocks on the door.)"
  JOHN," What are you doing?  SHERLOCK (calmly): Nicotine patch. Helps me think.  (He lifts his right hand to show that he has three round nicotine patches stuck to his arm and it was these which he was pressing against his skin to release the substances more quickly.)  SHERLOCK: Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work.  (He loudly clicks the ‘k’ on the last word. Your transcriber dutifully wibbles.)  JOHN (walking further into the room): It’s good news for breathing.  SHERLOCK (dismissively): Oh, breathing. Breathing’s boring.  (John frowns as he looks more closely at Sherlock’s arm.)  JOHN: Is that three patches?  SHERLOCK (pressing his hands together in the prayer position under his chin): It’s a three-patch problem.  (He closes his eyes. John looks around the room for a moment, then looks down at Sherlock again.)  JOHN: Well?  (Sherlock doesn’t respond.)  JOHN: You asked me to come. I’m assuming it’s important.  (Sherlock still doesn’t respond instantly, but after a couple of seconds his eyes snap open. He doesn’t bother turning his head to look at John.)  SHERLOCK: Oh, yeah, of course. Can I borrow your phone?  JOHN: My phone?  SHERLOCK: Don’t wanna use mine. Always a chance that the number will be recognised. It’s on the website.  JOHN: Mrs Hudson’s got a phone.  SHERLOCK: Yeah, she’s downstairs. I tried shouting but she didn’t hear.  JOHN (beginning to get angry): I was the other side of London.  SHERLOCK (mildly): There was no hurry.  (John glares at him as he gazes serenely at the ceiling before closing his eyes again. Eventually John digs his phone out of his jacket pocket and holds it towards him.)  JOHN: Here.  (Without opening his eyes, Sherlock holds out his right hand with the palm up. John glowers at him for a moment, then steps forward and slaps the phone into his hand. Sherlock slowly lifts his arm and puts his hands together again, this time with the phone in between his palms. John turns and walks a few paces away before turning around again.)  JOHN: So what’s this about – the case?  SHERLOCK (softly): Her case.  JOHN: Her case?  SHERLOCK (opening his eyes): Her suitcase, yes, obviously. The murderer took her suitcase. First big mistake.  JOHN: Okay, he took her case. So?  SHERLOCK (quietly, as if to himself): It’s no use, there’s no other way. We’ll have to risk it.  (Raising his voice a little, he imperiously holds the phone out towards John, still not looking at him.)  SHERLOCK: On my desk there’s a number. I want you to send a text.  (John half-smiles in angry disbelief.)  JOHN (tightly): You brought me here ... to send a text.  SHERLOCK (oblivious to his anger): Text, yes. The number on my desk.  (He continues to hold the phone out while John glowers at him, possibly wondering if he can get away with justifiable homicide. Eventually he stomps across the room and snatches the phone from Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock refolds his hands under his chin and closes his eyes but instead of going to the table, John walks over to the window and looks out into the street below. Sherlock opens his eyes and tilts his head slightly towards him.)  SHERLOCK: What’s wrong?  JOHN: Just met a friend of yours.  (Sherlock frowns in confusion.)  SHERLOCK: A friend?  JOHN: An enemy.  (Sherlock immediately relaxes.)  SHERLOCK (calmly): Oh. Which one?  JOHN: Your arch-enemy, according to him. (He turns towards Sherlock.) Do people have arch-enemies?  (Sherlock looks towards him, narrowing his eyes suspiciously.)  SHERLOCK: Did he offer you money to spy on me?  JOHN: Yes.  SHERLOCK: Did you take it?  JOHN: No.  SHERLOCK: Pity. We could have split the fee. Think it through next time.  JOHN: Who is he?  SHERLOCK (softly): The most dangerous man you’ve ever met, and not my problem right now. (More loudly) On my desk, the number.  (John gives him a dark look but Sherlock has already looked away again so John walks over to the desk and picks up a piece of paper taken from a luggage label. He looks at the name on the paper.)  JOHN: Jennifer Wilson. That was ... Hang on. Wasn’t that the dead woman?  SHERLOCK: Yes. That’s not important. Just enter the number.  (Shaking his head, John gets his phone out and starts to type the number onto it.)  SHERLOCK: Are you doing it?  JOHN: Yes.  SHERLOCK: Have you done it?  JOHN: Ye... hang on!  SHERLOCK: These words exactly: “What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.”  (John starts to type but looks briefly across to Sherlock as if concerned at what he just said. Sherlock continues his narration.)  SHERLOCK: “Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come.”  (John has got as far as:   What happened at  Lauriston Gdns?  I must have b   Now he looks across to Sherlock again, frowning.)  JOHN: You blacked out?  SHERLOCK: What? No. No!  (He flips his legs around and stands up, taking the shortest route towards the kitchen – which involves walking over the coffee table beside the sofa rather than around it.)  SHERLOCK: Type and send it. Quickly.  (Going into the kitchen, he picks up a small pink suitcase from a chair and brings it back into the living room. Walking over to the dining table, he lifts one of the dining chairs and flips it around, setting it down in front of one of the two armchairs near the fireplace. He puts the suitcase onto the dining chair and sits down in the armchair. John is still typing.)  SHERLOCK: Have you sent it?  JOHN: What’s the address?  SHERLOCK (impatiently): Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Hurry up!  (John finishes the message, then looks round as Sherlock unzips the case and flips open the lid, revealing the contents. There are a few items of clothing and underwear – all in varying shades of pink – a washbag, and a paperback novel by Paul Bunch entitled “Come To Bed Eyes.” [Good grief – has Jennifer met Sherlock before?!]. As John turns towards the case he staggers slightly in shock when he realises what he’s looking at.)  JOHN: That’s ... that’s the pink lady’s case. That’s Jennifer Wilson’s case.  SHERLOCK (studying the case closely): Yes, obviously.  (John continues to stare, and Sherlock looks up at him and then rolls his eyes.)  SHERLOCK (sarcastically): Oh, perhaps I should mention: I didn’t kill her.  JOHN: I never said you did.  SHERLOCK: Why not? Given the text I just had you send and the fact that I have her case, it’s a perfectly logical assumption.  JOHN: Do people usually assume you’re the murderer?  SHERLOCK (smirking): Now and then, yes.  (He puts his hands onto the arms of the armchair and lifts his feet up and under him so that he is perching on the seat with his backside braced against the back rest, then clasps his hands under his chin.)  JOHN: Okay ...  (He limps across the room and drops heavily into the armchair on the other side of the fireplace.)  JOHN: How did you get this?  SHERLOCK: By looking.  JOHN: Where?  SHERLOCK: The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens. He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car. Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention – particularly a man, which is statistically more likely – so obviously he’d feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it. Wouldn’t have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake. I checked every back street wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens ...  (Cut-away shot of Sherlock standing on the edge of a rooftop looking down into the streets below as he searches for a glimpse of places where the case might have been hidden.)  SHERLOCK: ... and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed.  (Cut-away shot of Sherlock back on the ground and rooting through a large skip in an alley before unearthing the case buried under some black plastic, then checking the luggage label attached to the handle.)  SHERLOCK: Took me less than an hour to find the right skip.  JOHN: Pink. You got all that because you realised the case would be pink?  SHERLOCK: Well, it had to be pink, obviously.  JOHN (to himself): Why didn’t I think of that?  SHERLOCK: Because you’re an idiot.  (John looks across to him, startled. Sherlock makes a placatory gesture with one hand.)  SHERLOCK: No, no, no, don’t look like that. Practically everyone is.  (He refolds his hands and then extends his index fingers to point at the case.)  SHERLOCK: Now, look. Do you see what’s missing?  JOHN: From the case? How could I?  SHERLOCK: Her phone. Where’s her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body, there’s no phone in the case. We know she had one – that’s her number there; you just texted it.  JOHN: Maybe she left it at home.  (Sherlock puts his hands onto the arms of the chair and raises himself up so that he can lower his feet to the floor, then sits down properly on the chair.)  SHERLOCK: She has a string of lovers and she’s careful about it. She never leaves her phone at home.  (He puts the slip of paper back into the luggage label on the case and looks at John expectantly.)  JOHN: Er ...  (He looks down at his mobile phone which he has put onto the arm of his chair.)  JOHN: Why did I just send that text?  SHERLOCK: Well, the question is: where is her phone now?  JOHN: She could have lost it.  SHERLOCK: Yes, or ...?  JOHN (slowly): The murderer ... You think the murderer has the phone?  SHERLOCK: Maybe she left it when she left her case. Maybe he took it from her for some reason. Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.  JOHN: Sorry, what are we doing? Did I just text a murderer?! What good will that do?  (As if on cue, his phone begins to ring. He picks it up and looks at the screen for the Caller I.D. It reads:   (withheld)  calling   He looks across to Sherlock as the phone continues to ring.)  SHERLOCK: A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her. If somebody had just found that phone they’d ignore a text like that, but the murderer ...  (He pauses dramatically for a moment until the phone stops ringing.)  SHERLOCK: ... would panic.  (He flips the lid of the suitcase closed and stands up, walking across the room to pick up his jacket. As John continues to stare down at his phone, Sherlock puts on his jacket and walks towards the door.)  JOHN (finally looking up): Have you talked to the police?  SHERLOCK: Four people are dead. There isn’t time to talk to the police.  JOHN: So why are you talking to me?  (Sherlock reaches behind the door to take his greatcoat from the hook. As he looks across towards John he notices that something is missing from the mantelpiece.)  SHERLOCK: Mrs Hudson took my skull.  JOHN: So I’m basically filling in for your skull?  SHERLOCK (putting on his coat): Relax, you’re doing fine.  (John doesn’t move.)  SHERLOCK: Well?  JOHN: Well what?  SHERLOCK: Well, you could just sit there and watch telly.  JOHN: What, you want me to come with you?  SHERLOCK: I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud. The skull just attracts attention, so ...  (John smiles briefly.)  SHERLOCK: Problem?  JOHN: Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.  SHERLOCK (looking away in exasperation): What about her?  JOHN: She said ... You get off on this. You enjoy it.  SHERLOCK (nonchalantly): And I said “dangerous,” and here you are.  (Instantly he turns and walks out of the door. John sits there thoughtfully for a few seconds, then almost angrily leans onto his cane to push himself to his feet and head for the door.)  JOHN: Damn it!   Not long afterwards, John catches up to Sherlock in the street and they continue down the road.  JOHN: Where are we going?  SHERLOCK: Northumberland Street’s a five-minute walk from here.  JOHN: You think he’s stupid enough to go there?  SHERLOCK (smiling expectantly): No – I think he’s brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones. They’re always so desperate to get caught.  JOHN: Why?  SHERLOCK: Appreciation! Applause! At long last the spotlight. That’s the frailty of genius, John: it needs an audience.  JOHN (looking pointedly at him): Yeah.  (Oblivious to the implication, Sherlock spins around to indicate the entire area as he continues down the road.)  SHERLOCK: This is his hunting ground, right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go.  (He holds his hands up on either side of his head as if to focus his thoughts.)  SHERLOCK: Think! Who do we trust, even though we don’t know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?  JOHN: Dunno. Who?  SHERLOCK (shrugging): Haven’t the faintest. Hungry?  (Lowering his hands, he leads John onwards and into a small restaurant. The waiter near the door clearly knows him and gestures to a reserved table at the front window.)  SHERLOCK: Thank you, Billy.  (Taking off his coat, he sits down on the bench seat at the side of the table and immediately turns sideways so that he can see clearly out of the window. As Billy takes the ‘Reserved’ sign off the table, John sits down on the other bench seat with his back to the window, and takes off his jacket.)  SHERLOCK (nodding to a building over the road): Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Keep your eyes on it.  JOHN: He isn’t just gonna ring the doorbell, though, is he? He’d need to be mad.  SHERLOCK: He has killed four people.  JOHN: ... Okay.  (The manager and/or owner of the restaurant comes over, clearly pleased to see Sherlock.)  ANGELO: Sherlock.  (They shake hands.)  ANGELO: Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free.  (He lays a couple of menus on the table.)  ANGELO: On the house, for you and for your date.  SHERLOCK (to John): Do you want to eat?  JOHN (to Angelo): I’m not his date.  ANGELO: This man got me off a murder charge.  SHERLOCK: This is Angelo.  (Angelo offers his hand to John, who shakes it.)  SHERLOCK: Three years ago I successfully proved to Lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking.  ANGELO (to John): He cleared my name.  SHERLOCK: I cleared it a bit. Anything happening opposite?  ANGELO: Nothing. (He looks at John again.) But for this man, I’d have gone to prison.  SHERLOCK: You did go to prison.  ANGELO (to John): I’ll get a candle for the table. It’s more romantic.  JOHN (indignantly, as Angelo walks away): I’m not his date!  (Sherlock puts his own menu down onto the table.)  SHERLOCK: You may as well eat. We might have a long wait.  (Angelo comes back with a small glass bowl containing a lit tea-light. He puts it onto the table and gives John a thumbs-up before turning and walking away again.)  JOHN (a little tetchily): Thanks(!)   Later, John has a plate of food in front of him and is eating from it. Sherlock’s attention is fixed out of the window and he is quietly drumming his fingers on the table.  JOHN: People don’t have arch-enemies.  (It takes a moment but Sherlock finally looks round.)  SHERLOCK: I’m sorry?  JOHN: In real life. There are no arch-enemies in real life. Doesn’t happen.  SHERLOCK (disinterestedly, looking out of the window again): Doesn’t it? Sounds a bit dull.  JOHN: So who did I meet?  SHERLOCK: What do real people have, then, in their ‘real lives’?  JOHN: Friends; people they know; people they like; people they don’t like ... Girlfriends, boyfriends ...  SHERLOCK: Yes, well, as I was saying – dull.  JOHN: You don’t have a girlfriend, then?  SHERLOCK (still looking out of the window): Girlfriend? No, not really my area.  JOHN: Mm.  (A moment passes before he realises the possible significance of this statement.)  JOHN: Oh, right. D’you have a boyfriend?  (Sherlock looks round at him sharply.)  JOHN: Which is fine, by the way.  SHERLOCK: I know it’s fine.  (John smiles to indicate that he wasn’t signifying anything negative by what he said.)  JOHN: So you’ve got a boyfriend then?  SHERLOCK: No.  JOHN (still smiling, though his smile is becoming a little fixed and awkward): Right. Okay. You’re unattached. Like me. (He looks down at his plate, apparently rapidly running out of things to say.) Fine. (He clears his throat.) Good.  (He continues eating. Sherlock looks at him suspiciously for a moment but then turns his attention out of the window again. However, he then appears to replay John’s statement in his head and looks a little startled. Turning his head towards John again, he starts speaking rather awkwardly but rapidly speeds up and is almost babbling by the time John interrupts him.)  SHERLOCK: John, um ... I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I’m flattered by your interest, I’m really not looking for any ...  JOHN (interrupting): No. (He turns his head briefly to clear his throat.) No, I’m not asking. No.  (He fixes his gaze onto Sherlock’s, apparently trying to convey his sincerity.)  JOHN: I’m just saying, it’s all fine.  (Sherlock looks at him for a moment, then nods.)  SHERLOCK: Good. Thank you.  (He turns his attention back to the street. John looks away with an bemused expression on his face as if asking himself, ‘What the heck was all that about?!’ Just then, Sherlock nods out of the window.)  SHERLOCK: Look across the street. Taxi.  (John twists in his seat to look out of the window where a taxi has parked at the side of the road with its back end towards the restaurant.)  SHERLOCK: Stopped. Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out.  (In the rear seat of the taxi the male passenger is looking through the side windows as if trying to see somebody particular.)  SHERLOCK (to himself): Why a taxi? Oh, that’s clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?  JOHN: That’s him?  SHERLOCK: Don’t stare.  JOHN (looking round at him): You’re staring.  SHERLOCK: We can’t both stare.  (Getting to his feet, he grabs his coat and scarf and heads for the door. John picks up his own jacket and follows ... completely forgetting to take his walking cane with him. Outside the door, Sherlock shrugs himself into his coat while keeping his eyes fixed on the taxi. The passenger continues to look around him, then turns and looks out the back window. His gaze falls on the restaurant and he looks at it for a few moments while Sherlock stares back at him, then the man turns towards the front of the vehicle and the taxi begins to pull away from the kerb. Sherlock immediately heads towards it without bothering to check the road that he’s running into and is almost run over by a car coming from his left. The driver slams on the brakes and stops the car but Sherlock, always keen to take the quickest route, allows his forward impetus to carry him onto the top of the bonnet. He rolls over the bonnet, lands on his feet on the other side and then runs after the taxi. As the driver of the car angrily sounds his horn, John puts one hand on the bonnet and vaults over the front of the car, apologising to the driver as he goes.)  JOHN: Sorry.  (He chases after Sherlock, who runs a few yards up the road before realising that he’s not going to catch the taxi and slows to a halt. John catches up and stops beside him.)  JOHN: I’ve got the cab number.  SHERLOCK: Good for you.  (He brings his hands up to either side of his head and concentrates, calling up a mental map of the local area and overlaying it with images of the streets along the route which he calculates that the taxi must take.)  SHERLOCK (quick fire): Right turn, one way, roadworks, traffic lights, bus lane, pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic lights.  (Having worked out the route, he lifts his head and sees a man unlocking the door to a nearby building. Instantly his mind flashes up a signpost saying, “ALTERNATIVE ROUTE.” Sherlock races towards the man and grabs him, shoving him out of the way before charging into the building.)  MAN: Oi!  (John hurries after Sherlock, raising an apologetic hand to the man as he goes.)  JOHN: Sorry.  (The two of them race up the stairs and out onto a metal spiral fire escape staircase leading to the roof. Sherlock, the lanky git, takes the steps two or even three at a time and John struggles to keep up with him as he scurries up behind him.)  SHERLOCK: Come on, John.  (Reaching the top of the stairs, Sherlock runs to the edge and looks over before seeing a shorter metal spiral staircase leading down the side of the building to another door one floor lower. He gallops down the stairs and climbs onto the railing before leaping across the gap to the next building. John scrambles onto the railing and follows. Sherlock runs across to the other side of the roof and again leaps across to the next building. John races after him, but then skids to a halt when he realises that the gap may be too big for him to jump across. As if in sympathy, pedestrian traffic lights on the ground change from the green “It is safe to cross” sign to the red “Stop and wait” sign. John hesitates, looking down at the drop beneath him.)  SHERLOCK: Come on, John. We’re losing him!  (John backs up a few paces and braces himself. As the traffic lights change to “Safe to cross” again, he takes a run-up and and leaps the gap. Dropping down onto a walkway along the side of the building, the boys run onwards. The taxi continues its journey on the ground and the boys gallop down another metal staircase, then run to a ledge and drop down into an alleyway before running onwards again. Sherlock leads John down the alleyway as, in his head, a map shows their location in comparison to where the taxi must be. Their paths are beginning to get closer and they are heading towards a point where Sherlock and John will exit the alleyway onto D’Arblay Street, into which the taxi is just turning. Sherlock turns the corner and races down the last part of the alley, only to see the taxi drive past the end, heading to the left.)  SHERLOCK (angrily): Ah, no!  (Without breaking stride, he races out of the end of the alley and turns right.)  SHERLOCK: This way.  (Instinctively John turns left in pursuit of the taxi.)  SHERLOCK: No, this way!  JOHN: Sorry.  (He turns and heads back in the opposite direction, following Sherlock. In Sherlock’s mind-map, he picks a new point where he and John can intercept the cab. The boys run down the street, taking a shorter route than the taxi which is being diverted by various road signs taking it the long way around. They head down more alleyways and side streets towards the interception point in Wardour Street and finally, at the precise point which his mental map predicted, Sherlock races out of a side street and hurls himself into the path of the approaching cab, which screeches to a halt as he crashes hard into the bonnet. Scrabbling in his left coat pocket, Sherlock pulls out an I.D. badge and flashes it at the driver as he runs to the right hand side of the cab.)  SHERLOCK: Police! Open her up!  (Panting heavily, he tugs open the rear door and stares in at the passenger, who looks back at him anxiously. Instantly Sherlock straightens up in exasperation just as John joins him.)  SHERLOCK: No.  (He leans down again to look at the passenger a second time.)  SHERLOCK: Teeth, tan: what – Californian?  (He looks at something on the floor in front of the passenger.)  SHERLOCK: L.A., Santa Monica. Just arrived.  (He straightens up again, grimacing.)  JOHN: How can you possibly know that?  SHERLOCK: The luggage.  (He looks down at the suitcase on the floor of the cab and its luggage label showing that the man has flown from LAX [Los Angeles International Airport] to LHR [London Heathrow Airport].)  SHERLOCK (to the passenger): It’s probably your first trip to London, right, going by your final destination and the route the cabbie was taking you?  PASSENGER: Sorry – are you guys the police?  SHERLOCK: Yeah. (He flashes the I.D. badge briefly at the man.) Everything all right?  PASSENGER (smiling): Yeah.  (Sherlock pauses for a moment as if wondering how to finish this conversation, then smiles falsely at the man.)  SHERLOCK: Welcome to London.  (He immediately walks away, leaving John staring blankly for a moment before he steps closer to the taxi door and looks in at the passenger.)  JOHN: Er, any problems, just let us know.  (As the man nods, John smiles politely and slams the cab door shut. The man looks round to the taxi driver in bewilderment. John walks to where Sherlock has stopped a few yards behind the vehicle.)  JOHN: Basically just a cab that happened to slow down.  SHERLOCK: Basically.  JOHN: Not the murderer.  SHERLOCK (exasperated): Not the murderer, no.  JOHN: Wrong country, good alibi.  SHERLOCK: As they go.  (John notices as Sherlock switches the I.D. card from one hand to another.)  JOHN: Hey, where-where did you get this? Here.  (He reaches for the card and Sherlock releases it.)  JOHN: Right. (He looks at the name on the card.) Detective Inspector Lestrade?  SHERLOCK: Yeah. I pickpocket him when he’s annoying. You can keep that one, I’ve got plenty at the flat.  (John nods, then looks down at the card again before lifting his head and giggling silently.)  SHERLOCK: What?  JOHN: Nothing, just: “Welcome to London.”  (Sherlock chuckles, then looks down the road to where a police officer has apparently gone to investigate why the cab has stopped in the middle of the street. The passenger has got out and is pointing down the road towards the boys.)  SHERLOCK (to John): Got your breath back?  JOHN: Ready when you are.  (They turn and run off down the road.)   221B. The boys have arrived back and walk along the hallway, breathing heavily. John hangs his jacket on a hook on the wall while Sherlock drapes his coat over the bottom of the bannisters.  JOHN: Okay, that was ridiculous.  (They lean side by side against the wall, still trying to catch their breath.)  JOHN: That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.  SHERLOCK: And you invaded Afghanistan.  (John giggles adorably and after a moment Sherlock also begins to laugh.)  JOHN: That wasn’t just me.  (Sherlock chuckles.)  JOHN: Why aren’t we back at the restaurant?  SHERLOCK (becoming more serious and waving his hand dismissively): Oh, they can keep an eye out. It was a long shot anyway.  JOHN: So what were we doing there?  (Sherlock clears his throat.)  SHERLOCK: Oh, just passing the time.  (He looks at John.)  SHERLOCK: And proving a point.  JOHN: What point?  SHERLOCK: You.  (He turns and calls loudly towards the door to Mrs Hudson’s ground floor flat.)  SHERLOCK: Mrs Hudson! Doctor Watson will take the room upstairs.  JOHN: Says who?  SHERLOCK (looking towards the front door): Says the man at the door.  (John turns his head towards the door just as someone knocks on it three times. He turns back to look at Sherlock in surprise. Sherlock smiles. John stares at him for a moment, then walks along the hall to answer the door. Sherlock leans his head against the wall and blows out a breath. John opens the door and finds Angelo standing outside.)  ANGELO: Sherlock texted me.  (Smiling, he holds up John’s walking cane.)  ANGELO: He said you forgot this.  (John stares at the cane in surprise, then takes it.)  JOHN: Ah.  (He turns and looks down the hall to Sherlock, who grins at him.)  JOHN (turning back to Angelo): Er, thank you. Thank you.  (As he comes back in and closes the door, Mrs Hudson comes out of her flat and hurries over to the boys. She sounds upset and tearful as she speaks.)  MRS HUDSON: Sherlock, what have you done?  SHERLOCK: Mrs Hudson?  MRS HUDSON: Upstairs.  (Sherlock turns and hurries up the stairs, John following him. Sherlock opens the living room door and goes inside, where he finds D.I. Lestrade sitting casually in the armchair facing the door. Other police officers are going through Sherlock’s possessions. Sherlock storms over to Lestrade.)  SHERLOCK: What are you doing?  LESTRADE: Well, I knew you’d find the case. I’m not stupid.  SHERLOCK: You can’t just break into my flat.  LESTRADE: And you can’t withhold evidence. And I didn’t break into your flat.  SHERLOCK: Well, what do you call this then?  LESTRADE (looking round at his officers before looking back to Sherlock innocently): It’s a drugs bust.  JOHN: Seriously?! This guy, a junkie?! Have you met him?!  (Sherlock turns and walks closer to John, biting his lip nervously.)  SHERLOCK: John ...  JOHN (to Lestrade): I’m pretty sure you could search this flat all day, you wouldn’t find anything you could call recreational.  SHERLOCK: John, you probably want to shut up now.  JOHN: Yeah, but come on ...  (He looks into Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock holds his gaze for a long moment and John falls deeply and instantly in love realises how serious he’s looking.)  JOHN: No.  SHERLOCK: What?  JOHN: You?  SHERLOCK (angrily): Shut up!  (He turns back to Lestrade.)  SHERLOCK: I’m not your sniffer dog.  LESTRADE: No, Anderson‘s my sniffer dog.  (He nods towards the kitchen.)  SHERLOCK: What, An...  (The closed doors to the kitchen slide open and reveal several more officers in there searching through the room. Anderson turns towards the living room and raises his hand in sarcastic greeting.)  SHERLOCK (angrily): Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?  ANDERSON (venomously): Oh, I volunteered.  (Sherlock turns away, biting his lip angrily.)  LESTRADE: They all did. They’re not strictly speaking on the drugs squad, but they’re very keen.  (Donovan comes into view from the kitchen, holding a small glass jar with some white round objects in it.)  DONOVAN: Are these human eyes?  SHERLOCK: Put those back!  DONOVAN: They were in the microwave!  SHERLOCK: It’s an experiment.  LESTRADE: Keep looking, guys.  (He stands up and turns to Sherlock.)  LESTRADE: Or you could help us properly and I’ll stand them down.  SHERLOCK (pacing angrily): This is childish.  LESTRADE: Well, I’m dealing with a child. Sherlock, this is our case. I’m letting you in, but you do not go off on your own. Clear?  SHERLOCK (stopping and glaring at him): Oh, what, so-so-so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?  LESTRADE: It stops being pretend if they find anything.  SHERLOCK (loudly): I am clean!  LESTRADE: Is your flat? All of it?  SHERLOCK: I don’t even smoke.  (He unbuttons the cuff of his left shirt and pulls it up to show a nicotine patch on his lower arm. Presumably he removed the other two earlier.)  LESTRADE: Neither do I.  (He pulls up the right sleeves of his own jacket and shirt to show a similar patch on his arm. Sherlock rolls his eyes and turns away and they both pull their sleeves back down again.)  LESTRADE: So let’s work together. We’ve found Rachel.  SHERLOCK (turning back to him): Who is she?  LESTRADE: Jennifer Wilson’s only daughter.  SHERLOCK (frowning): Her daughter? Why would she write her daughter’s name? Why?  ANDERSON: Never mind that. We found the case.  (He points to the pink suitcase in the living room.)  ANDERSON: According to someone, the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath.  SHERLOCK (looking at him disparagingly): I’m not a psychopath, Anderson. I’m a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.  (He turns back to Lestrade.)  SHERLOCK: You need to bring Rachel in. You need to question her. I need to question her.  LESTRADE: She’s dead.  SHERLOCK: Excellent!  (John looks startled.)  SHERLOCK (to Lestrade): How, when and why? Is there a connection? There has to be.  LESTRADE: Well, I doubt it, since she’s been dead for fourteen years. Technically she was never alive. Rachel was Jennifer Wilson’s stillborn daughter, fourteen years ago.  (John grimaces sadly and turns away. Sherlock, on the other hand, just looks confused.)  SHERLOCK: No, that’s ... that’s not right. How ... Why would she do that? Why?  ANDERSON: Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments?(!) Yup – sociopath; I’m seeing it now.  SHERLOCK (turning to him with an exasperated look on his face): She didn’t think about her daughter. She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails. She was dying. It took effort. It would have hurt.  (He begins to pace back and forth across the room again.)  JOHN: You said that the victims all took the poison themselves, that he makes them take it. Well, maybe he ... I don’t know, talks to them? Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.  SHERLOCK (stopping and turning to him): Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?  (John stares at him. Sherlock hesitates when he realises that everyone in the flat has stopped what they’re doing and has fallen silent. He glances around the room and then looks awkwardly at John.)  SHERLOCK: Not good?  JOHN (also glancing around at the others before turning back to Sherlock): Bit not good, yeah.  (Sherlock shakes it off and steps closer to John, looking at him intently.)  SHERLOCK: Yeah, but if you were dying ... if you’d been murdered: in your very last few seconds what would you say?  JOHN: “Please, God, let me live.”  SHERLOCK (exasperated): Oh, use your imagination!  JOHN: I don’t have to.  (Sherlock seems to recognise the look of pain in John’s face. He pauses momentarily and blinks a couple of times, shifting his feet apologetically before continuing.)  SHERLOCK: Yeah, but if you were clever, really clever ... Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers: she was clever.  (He starts to pace again.)  SHERLOCK: She’s trying to tell us something.  (Mrs Hudson comes to the door of the living room.)  MRS HUDSON: Isn’t the doorbell working? Your taxi’s here, Sherlock.  SHERLOCK: I didn’t order a taxi. Go away.  (He continues pacing as Mrs Hudson looks around the room.)  MRS HUDSON: Oh, dear. They’re making such a mess. What are they looking for?  JOHN: It’s a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.  MRS HUDSON (anxiously): But they’re just for my hip. They’re herbal soothers.  (With his back to the door, Sherlock stops and shouts out.)  SHERLOCK: Shut up, everybody, shut up! Don’t move, don’t speak, don’t breathe. I’m trying to think. Anderson, face the other way. You’re putting me off.  ANDERSON: What? My face is?!  LESTRADE: Everybody quiet and still. Anderson, turn your back.  ANDERSON: Oh, for God’s sake!  LESTRADE (sternly): Your back, now, please!  SHERLOCK (to himself): Come on, think. Quick!  MRS HUDSON: What about your taxi?  SHERLOCK (turning to her and shouting furiously): MRS HUDSON!  (She turns and hurries away down the stairs. Sherlock stops and looks around as he finally realises something.)  SHERLOCK: Oh.  (He smiles in delight.)  SHERLOCK: Ah! She was clever, clever, yes!  (He walks across the room and then turns back to the others.)  SHERLOCK: She’s cleverer than you lot and she’s dead. Do you see, do you get it? She didn’t lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted it on him.  (He starts pacing again.)  SHERLOCK: When she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death. She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.  LESTRADE: But how?  SHERLOCK (stopping and staring at him): Wha...? What do you mean, how?  (Lestrade shrugs.)  SHERLOCK: Rachel!  (He looks at everyone triumphantly. They all look back at him blankly.)  SHERLOCK: Don’t you see? Rachel!  (Still everyone looks blank. Sherlock laughs in disbelief.)  SHERLOCK: Oh, look at you lot. You’re all so vacant. Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing. (More sternly) Rachel is not a name.  JOHN (equally sternly): Then what is it?  SHERLOCK: John, on the luggage, there’s a label. E-mail address.  (John looks at the label on the suitcase and reads out the address.)  JOHN: Er, jennie dot pink at mephone dot org dot uk.  (Sherlock has sat down at the dining table and is looking at his computer notebook.)  SHERLOCK: Oh, I’ve been too slow. She didn’t have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone, so it’s a smartphone, it’s e-mail enabled.  (He has pulled up Mephone’s website and types the email address into the ‘User name’ box.)  SHERLOCK: So there was a website for her account. The username is her e-mail address ...  (He begins to type into the ‘Password’ box.)  SHERLOCK: ... and all together now, the password is?  JOHN (walking over to stand behind him): Rachel.  ANDERSON: So we can read her e-mails. So what?  SHERLOCK: Anderson, don’t talk out loud. You lower the I.Q. of the whole street. We can do much more than just read her e-mails. It’s a smartphone, it’s got GPS, which means if you lose it you can locate it online. She’s leading us directly to the man who killed her.  LESTRADE: Unless he got rid of it.  JOHN: We know he didn’t.  (Sherlock looks at the screen impatiently.)  SHERLOCK: Come on, come on. Quickly!  (Mrs Hudson trots up the stairs and comes to the door again.)  MRS HUDSON: Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver ...  (Sherlock gets to his feet and walks over towards her.)  SHERLOCK: Mrs Hudson, isn’t it time for your evening soother?  (John sits down on the chair which Sherlock vacated and watches a clock spinning round on the website as it claims that the phone will be located in under three minutes. Sherlock turns to Lestrade.)  SHERLOCK: We need to get vehicles, get a helicopter.  (Mrs Hudson looks around anxiously as a man walks slowly up the stairs behind her.)  SHERLOCK (to Lestrade): We’re gonna have to move fast. This phone battery won’t last for ever.  LESTRADE: We’ll just have a map reference, not a name.  SHERLOCK: It’s a start!  (On the computer, a map has appeared and is now zooming in on the location of the phone.)  JOHN: Sherlock ...  SHERLOCK (to Lestrade): It narrows it down from just anyone in London. It’s the first proper lead that we’ve had.  JOHN: Sherlock ...  SHERLOCK (hurrying across the room to look over John’s shoulder): What is it? Quickly, where?  (The map is now indicating the precise location of the phone.)  JOHN: It’s here. It’s in two two one Baker Street.  SHERLOCK (straightening up): How can it be here? How?  LESTRADE: Well, maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it fell out somewhere.  SHERLOCK: What, and I didn’t notice it? Me? I didn’t notice?  JOHN (to Lestrade): Anyway, we texted him and he called back.  (Lestrade turns to call out to his colleagues.)  LESTRADE: Guys, we’re also looking for a mobile somewhere here, belonged to the victim ...  (Sherlock tunes him out as he begins to remember questions he asked to John earlier.)  SHERLOCK (voiceover): ‘Who do we trust, even if we don’t know them?’  (Behind Mrs Hudson, the man has reached the top of the stairs. Wearing a cardigan and with a cap on his head obscuring his face, he has a badge in a leather holder on a cord around his neck. The badge is for a licenced London cab driver.)  SHERLOCK (voiceover): ‘Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?’  (In a cut-away, a black taxi drives down a rainy street with its sign lit indicating that it’s for hire.  In flashback, at the railway station Sir Jeffrey Patterson walks to the cab rank and raises his hand to a taxi.)  SHERLOCK (voiceover): ‘Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?’  (Sherlock stands lost in thought in the flat.)  (In flashback, James Phillimore walks alone across the road, huddled against the pouring rain, and a vacant taxi drives along the road behind him.  In flashback, Beth Davenport looks around despairingly when she realises that she doesn’t have her car keys. Nearby, a vacant cab pulls up.)  (In the flat, Sherlock turns, his mind racing as he puts all the clues together.)  (In flashback, Jennifer Wilson arrives at a London train terminus and gets into the back of a taxi.)  (Sherlock turns his head, still putting it all together. On the landing, the taxi driver takes a pink smartphone from his pocket and presses the screen to send a text. A moment later, Sherlock’s own phone chimes a text alert. Taking his phone from his jacket pocket he looks at the message which simply reads: COME WITH ME. As he turns his head towards the door, the taxi driver turns around and calmly heads off down the stairs.)  JOHN: Sherlock, you okay?  SHERLOCK (vaguely, watching the man go): What? Yeah, yeah, I-I’m fine.  JOHN: So, how can the phone be here?  SHERLOCK (still watching the taxi driver): Dunno.  JOHN (getting up to get his own phone out of his jeans pocket): I’ll try it again.  SHERLOCK: Good idea.  (He heads towards the door.)  JOHN: Where are you going?  SHERLOCK: Fresh air. Just popping outside for a moment. Won’t be long.  (John frowns as Sherlock leaves the room, and calls after him.)  JOHN: You sure you’re all right?  SHERLOCK (hurrying down the stairs): I’m fine."
 JEFF," Taxi for Sherlock ’olmes. (Sherlock steps forward, closing the door behind him.) SHERLOCK: I didn’t order a taxi. JEFF: Doesn’t mean you don’t need one. SHERLOCK: You’re the cabbie. The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street. (In flashback, the American man sits in the back of the cab outside the restaurant and turns his head to the front. In the driver’s seat, Jeff looks over his shoulder and through the rear window of the cab before turning around again and starting to drive away.) SHERLOCK: It was you, not your passenger. JEFF: See? No-one ever thinks about the cabbie. It’s like you’re invisible. Just the back of an ’ead. Proper advantage for a serial killer. (Sherlock takes a few more steps forward and looks up towards the windows of his flat.) SHERLOCK: Is this a confession? JEFF: Oh, yeah. An’ I’ll tell you what else: if you call the coppers now, I won’t run. I’ll sit quiet and they can take me down, I promise. SHERLOCK: Why? JEFF: ’Cause you’re not gonna do that. SHERLOCK: Am I not? JEFF: I didn’t kill those four people, Mr ’olmes. I spoke to ’em ... and they killed themselves. An’ if you get the coppers now, I promise you one thing. (He leans forward.) JEFF: I will never tell you what I said. (Sherlock stares at him. After a moment, Jeff straightens up and starts to walk around the front of the cab.) SHERLOCK: No-one else will die, though, and I believe they call that a result. (Jeff stops and turns back towards him.) JEFF: An’ you won’t ever understand how those people died. What kind of result do you care about? (He turns again and continues around to the driver’s door. Getting in, he sits down and closes the door, settling into his seat and ignoring Sherlock. Biting his lip, Sherlock walks closer to the cab, looking up again at the flat windows, then he bends and looks into the open side window of the cab.) SHERLOCK: If I wanted to understand, what would I do? JEFF (turning to look at him): Let me take you for a ride. SHERLOCK: So you can kill me too? JEFF: I don’t wanna kill you, Mr ’olmes. I’m gonna talk to yer ... and then you’re gonna kill yourself. (He turns to face the front again. Sherlock straightens up, his eyes lost in thought as he considers the situation. Jeff calmly sits gazing out of the front window, then smiles in satisfaction when the rear door opens. The cab dips as Sherlock gets in and then the door slams shut. Jeff starts the engine. Upstairs, John has his phone held to his ear and is looking out of the window. The cab can be heard as it pulls away.) JOHN: He just got in a cab. (He turns to Lestrade.) JOHN: It’s Sherlock. He just drove off in a cab. (Donovan, standing beside Lestrade, tuts in irritation.) DONOVAN: I told you, he does that. (She turns to Lestrade.) DONOVAN: He bloody left again. (She walks back into the kitchen, talking loudly.) DONOVAN: We’re wasting our time! JOHN (to Lestrade): I’m calling the phone. It’s ringing out. (In the cab, a phone is ringing. Sherlock watches Jeff as the pink phone – which Jeff has put in the well beside his seat – continues to ring. Back in the flat, Lestrade watches John as he continues to hold his phone to his ear.) LESTRADE: If it’s ringing, it’s not here. (John lowers his phone and reaches for the computer notebook.) JOHN: I’ll try the search again. (Donovan comes back to confront Lestrade.) DONOVAN: Does it matter? Does any of it? You know, he’s just a lunatic, and he’ll always let you down, and you’re wasting your time. All our time. (Lestrade stares at her for a long moment as she holds his gaze, then he sighs.) LESTRADE (loudly): Okay, everybody. Done ’ere. (In the cab, Sherlock is watching the London scenery pass by.) SHERLOCK: How did you find me? JEFF: Oh, I recognised yer, soon as I saw you chasing my cab. Sherlock ’olmes! I was warned about you. I’ve been on your website, too. Brilliant stuff! Loved it! SHERLOCK: Who warned you about me? JEFF: Just someone out there who’s noticed you. SHERLOCK: Who? (He leans forward, looking closely at the side of Jeff’s neck, then noticing a photograph of a young boy and girl attached to the dashboard of the cab.) SHERLOCK: Who would notice me? JEFF (meeting his eyes briefly in the rear view mirror): You’re too modest, Mr ’olmes. SHERLOCK: I’m really not. JEFF: You’ve got yourself a fan. SHERLOCK (nonchalantly, sitting back in his seat): Tell me more. JEFF: That’s all you’re gonna know ... (He pauses dramatically for a moment.) JEFF (quietly): ... in this lifetime. (Back at the flat, as the other police officers leave, Lestrade picks up his coat and turns to John.) LESTRADE: Why did he do that? Why did he have to leave? JOHN (shrugging): You know him better than I do. LESTRADE: I’ve known him for five years and no, I don’t. JOHN: So why do you put up with him? LESTRADE: Because I’m desperate, that’s why. (He walks to the door, then turns back.) LESTRADE: And because Sherlock Holmes is a great man. And I think one day, if we’re very, very lucky, he might even be a good one. (He turns and leaves. Some distance away, the cab drives on and finally stops at the front of two identical buildings side by side. Jeff turns off the engine and gets out, coming to the back door and opening it. He looks in at Sherlock.) SHERLOCK: Where are we? JEFF: You know every street in London. You know exactly where we are. SHERLOCK: Roland-Kerr Further Education College. Why here? JEFF: It’s open; cleaners are in. One thing about being a cabbie: you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder. I’m surprised more of us don’t branch out. SHERLOCK: And you just walk your victims in? How? (Jeff raises a pistol and points it at Sherlock. Sherlock rolls his eyes and turns his head away.) SHERLOCK: Oh, dull. JEFF: Don’t worry. It gets better. SHERLOCK: You can’t make people take their own lives at gunpoint. JEFF: I don’t. It’s much better than that. (He lowers the gun.) JEFF: Don’t need this with you, ’cause you’ll follow me. (He confidently walks away. Sherlock sits for a moment, then grimaces in exasperation at himself as he does just what Jeff predicted and gets out of the cab to follow the man.)  Back at 221B, John is alone in the flat. He appears to have decided to go home and walks towards the living room door, then looks down and clenches his right hand as if realising that he doesn’t have his walking cane. He looks round and sees the cane lying on top of a box of papers next to the dining table and goes over to collect it. With its back to him, Sherlock’s notebook is still on Mephone’s website and the clock is spinning on the screen while the site searches for Jennifer Wilson’s phone. As John picks up the cane and heads for the door again, the computer beeps triumphantly and a map appears on the screen and starts to zoom in on the new location of the phone. John turns back as the computer beeps repeatedly. Going back to the table and propping his cane against it, he picks up the notebook and looks at the screen, then he turns and takes the notebook with him as he hurries out of the door and down the stairs, once again forgetting to take his cane.  At Roland-Kerr College, Jeff opens the door of a room and stands aside so that Sherlock can go in. Sherlock looks at him closely but steps inside the room, then Jeff releases the door and lets it swing closed as he walks over to some switches on the wall and turns on the lights. The men are in a large classroom which has long fixed wooden benches and free-standing plastic chairs. Sherlock walks deeper into the room, looking around. JEFF: Well, what do you think? (Sherlock raises his hands and shrugs as if to ask, ‘What do I think about what?’) JEFF: It’s up to you. You’re the one who’s gonna die ’ere. (Sherlock turns back to him.) SHERLOCK: No, I’m not. JEFF: That’s what they all say. (He gestures to one of the benches.) JEFF: Shall we talk? (Without waiting for a reply, he pulls out one of the chairs and sits down. Sherlock takes a chair from the bench in front, flips it around and sits down opposite. He sighs dramatically while he takes off his gloves and puts them into his coat pockets.) SHERLOCK: Bit risky, wasn’t it? Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen. They’re not that stupid. And Mrs Hudson will remember you. JEFF: You call that a risk? Nah. (He reaches into the left pocket of his cardigan.) JEFF: This is a risk. (He takes out a small glass bottle with a screw top and puts it onto the table in front of him. There is a single large capsule inside. Sherlock looks at it but doesn’t react in any way.) JEFF: Ooh, I like this bit. ’Cause you don’t get it yet, do yer? But you’re about to. I just have to do this. (Reaching into his right pocket, he takes out an identical bottle containing an identical capsule and puts it onto the table beside the first bottle.) JEFF: You weren’t expecting that, were yer? (He leans forward.) JEFF: Ooh, you’re going to love this. SHERLOCK: Love what? JEFF (sitting back again): Sherlock ’olmes. Look at you! ’Ere in the flesh. That website of yours: your fan told me about it. SHERLOCK: My fan? JEFF: You are brilliant. You are. A proper genius. “The Science of Deduction.” Now that is proper thinking. Between you and me sitting ’ere, why can’t people think? (He looks down angrily.) JEFF: Don’t it make you mad? Why can’t people just think? (He looks up again into Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock looks back at him for a long moment, narrowing his eyes, then makes a realisation.) SHERLOCK (his voice dripping with sarcasm): Oh, I see. So you’re a proper genius too. JEFF: Don’t look it, do I? Funny little man drivin’ a cab. But you’ll know better in a minute. Chances are it’ll be the last thing you ever know. (Sherlock holds his gaze for a second or two, then looks down to the table.) SHERLOCK: Okay, two bottles. Explain. JEFF: There’s a good bottle and a bad bottle. You take the pill from the good bottle, you live; take the pill from the bad bottle, you die. SHERLOCK: Both bottles are of course identical. JEFF: In every way. SHERLOCK: And you know which is which. JEFF: Course I know. SHERLOCK: But I don’t. JEFF: Wouldn’t be a game if you knew. You’re the one who chooses. SHERLOCK: Why should I? I’ve got nothing to go on. What’s in it for me? JEFF: I ’aven’t told you the best bit yet. Whatever bottle you choose, I take the pill from the other one – and then, together, we take our medicine. (Sherlock starts to grin. Now he’s interested.) JEFF: I won’t cheat. It’s your choice. I’ll take whatever pill you don’t. (Sherlock looks down at the bottles, concentrating properly now.) JEFF: Didn’t expect that, did you, Mr ’olmes? SHERLOCK: This is what you did to the rest of them: you gave them a choice. JEFF: And now I’m givin’ you one. (Sherlock looks up at him.) JEFF: You take your time. Get yourself together. (He licks his lips in anticipation.) JEFF: I want your best game. SHERLOCK: It’s not a game. It’s chance. JEFF: I’ve played four times. I’m alive. It’s not chance, Mr ’olmes, it’s chess. It’s a game of chess, with one move, and one survivor. And this ... this ... is the move. (With his left hand he slides the left-hand bottle across the table towards Sherlock. He licks his top lip as he pulls his hand back and leaves the bottle where it is.) JEFF: Did I just give you the good bottle or the bad bottle? You can choose either one.  John is in the back of a taxi. He has the computer notebook open on his lap and is holding his phone to his ear. JOHN (into phone): No, Detective Inspector Lestrade. I need to speak to him. It’s important. It’s an emergency! (The map on the laptop shows the location of Jennifer’s phone again.) JOHN (to the cab driver): Er, left here, please. Left here.  ROLAND-KERR COLLEGE. Jeff looks down at the bottles briefly then meets Sherlock’s eyes. JEFF: You ready yet, Mr ’olmes? Ready to play? SHERLOCK: Play what? It’s a fifty-fifty chance. JEFF: You’re not playin’ the numbers, you’re playin’ me. Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? Is it a bluff? Or a double-bluff? Or a triple-bluff? SHERLOCK: Still just chance. JEFF: Four people in a row? It’s not just chance. SHERLOCK: Luck. JEFF: It’s genius. I know ’ow people think. (Sherlock rolls his eyes.) JEFF: I know ’ow people think I think. I can see it all, like a map inside my ’ead. (Sherlock looks exasperated.) JEFF: Everyone’s so stupid – even you. (Sherlock’s gaze sharpens.) JEFF: Or maybe God just loves me. (Sherlock straightens up and leans forward, clasping his hands in front of him on the table.) SHERLOCK: Either way, you’re wasted as a cabbie.  John has arrived at Roland-Kerr College. As the taxi pulls away, John tucks the notebook into his jacket and looks at the two identical buildings in front of him. Clearly the map isn’t precise enough to indicate exactly where the phone is. After a moment, he makes his choice and heads towards the buildings.  In the classroom, Sherlock lifts his clasped hands in front of his mouth and gazes at Jeff intently. SHERLOCK: So, you risked your life four times just to kill strangers. Why? (Jeff nods down to the bottles.) JEFF: Time to play. SHERLOCK (unfolding his fingers and adopting the prayer position in front of his mouth): Oh, I am playing. This is my turn. There’s shaving foam behind your left ear. Nobody’s pointed it out to you. (Flashback to Jeff sitting in the driver’s seat of the cab, which is when Sherlock noticed this.) SHERLOCK: Traces of where it’s happened before, so obviously you live on your own; there’s no-one to tell you. (Jeff tries not to fidget under Sherlock’s gaze.) SHERLOCK: But there’s a photograph of children. The children’s mother has been cut out of the picture. If she’d died, she’d still be there. (Flashback to the photograph attached to the dashboard of the cab. There is indeed a third person at the left of the photograph but the photo has been cut along that side to remove most of her image.) SHERLOCK: The photograph’s old but the frame’s new. You think of your children but you don’t get to see them. (Jeff’s gaze slides away from Sherlock and for the first time there’s a hint of pain in his eyes.) SHERLOCK: Estranged father. She took the kids, but you still love them and it still hurts. (He extends his index fingers.) SHERLOCK: Ah, but there’s more. (Jeff lifts his gaze back to Sherlock as he points his index fingers towards him.) SHERLOCK: Your clothes: recently laundered but everything you’re wearing’s at least ... three years old? Keeping up appearances but not planning ahead. And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What’s that about? (Jeff has got control of himself again and his expression says nothing as he gazes back at Sherlock. The detective’s eyes widen slightly as he makes his most important deduction.) SHERLOCK (softly): Ahh. Three years ago – is that when they told you? JEFF (flatly): Told me what? (Sherlock’s deduction seems to appear beside Jeff’s head:  DYING  SHERLOCK: That you’re a dead man walking. JEFF: So are you. SHERLOCK: You don’t have long, though. Am I right? (Jeff smiles.) JEFF: Aneurism. (He lifts his right hand and taps the side of his head.) JEFF: Right in ’ere. (Sherlock smiles in satisfaction.) JEFF: Any breath could be my last. SHERLOCK (frowning again): And because you’re dying, you’ve just murdered four people. JEFF: I’ve outlived four people. That’s the most fun you can ’ave on an aneurism. SHERLOCK (thoughtfully): No. No, there’s something else. You didn’t just kill four people because you’re bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator. Somehow this is about your children. JEFF (looking away and sighing): Ohh. (He looks at Sherlock again.) JEFF: You are good, ain’t you? SHERLOCK: But how? JEFF: When I die, they won’t get much, my kids. Not a lot of money in driving cabs. SHERLOCK: Or serial killing. JEFF: You’d be surprised. SHERLOCK: Surprise me. (Jeff leans forward.) JEFF: I ’ave a sponsor. SHERLOCK: You have a what? JEFF: For every life I take, money goes to my kids. The more I kill, the better off they’ll be. You see? It’s nicer than you think. SHERLOCK (frowning): Who’d sponsor a serial killer? JEFF (instantly): Who’d be a fan of Sherlock ’olmes? (They stare at each other for a moment.) JEFF: You’re not the only one to enjoy a good murder. There’s others out there just like you, except you’re just a man ... and they’re so much more than that. (The side of Sherlock’s nose twitches in distaste.) SHERLOCK: What d’you mean, more than a man? An organisation? What? JEFF: There’s a name no-one says, an’ I’m not gonna say it either. Now, enough chatter. (He nods down to the bottles.) JEFF: Time to choose. (Sherlock looks down to the bottles, his eyes moving from one to the other.)  Elsewhere in the college, John is running through the corridors.  JOHN (calling out): Sherlock? (He runs from door to door, trying them and peering in through windows.) JOHN: Sherlock!  CLASSROOM.  SHERLOCK: What if I don’t choose either? I could just walk out of here. (Sighing in a combination of exasperation and disappointment, Jeff lifts up the pistol and points it at Sherlock.) JEFF: You can take your fifty-fifty chance, or I can shoot you in the head. (Sherlock smiles calmly.) JEFF: Funnily enough, no-one’s ever gone for that option. SHERLOCK: I’ll have the gun, please. JEFF: Are you sure? SHERLOCK (still smiling): Definitely. The gun. JEFF: You don’t wanna phone a friend? (Sherlock smiles confidently.) SHERLOCK: The gun. (Jeff’s mouth tightens, and slowly he squeezes the trigger. A small flame bursts out of the end of the muzzle. Sherlock smiles smugly.) SHERLOCK: I know a real gun when I see one. (Calmly Jeff lifts the pistol/cigarette lighter and releases the trigger. The flame goes out.) JEFF: None of the others did. SHERLOCK: Clearly. Well, this has been very interesting. I look forward to the court case. (He stands up and walks towards the door. Jeff puts the gun onto the desk and calmly turns in his seat.) JEFF: Just before you go, did you figure it out ... (Sherlock stops at the door and half-turns towards him.) JEFF: ... which one’s the good bottle? SHERLOCK: Of course. Child’s play. JEFF: Well, which one, then? (Sherlock opens the door a little but shows no sign of leaving the room.) JEFF: Which one would you ’ave picked, just so I know whether I could have beaten you? (Sherlock closes the door again.) JEFF (chuckling): Come on. Play the game. (Slowly Sherlock walks back towards him. When he gets to the table, he reaches out and sweeps up the bottle nearest to Jeff, then walks past him. Jeff looks down at the other bottle with interest but his voice gives nothing away as he speaks.) JEFF: Oh. Interesting. (He picks up the other bottle as Sherlock looks down at the bottle in his own hand.  Out in the corridors, John is still running along and searching.  In the classroom, Jeff has opened his bottle and tips the capsule out into his hand. He holds it up and looks at it closely while Sherlock examines his own bottle.) JEFF: So what d’you think? (He looks up at Sherlock.) JEFF: Shall we? (In the corridors, John pulls open yet another door and looks inside the room before hurrying onwards.) JEFF: Really, what do you think? (He has stood up and is facing Sherlock.) JEFF: Can you beat me? (John races up a flight of stairs and continues his search.) JEFF: Are you clever enough to bet your life? (John bursts through a door and stares ahead of him as he finally sees who he’s looking for. His eyes fill with horror. Inside the classroom, Sherlock lifts his gaze from the bottle he’s holding and looks towards the door ... and the camera zooms over his shoulder and out of the window behind him, soaring across the courtyard outside and in through another window to reveal John standing in an identical classroom in the other building, too far away to be of help. John cries out in horror.) JOHN: SHERLOCK! (Unaware that they’re being watched, Jeff continues to hold up his pill as he looks at Sherlock.) JEFF: I bet you get bored, don’t you? I know you do. A man like you ... (Sherlock unscrews the lid of the bottle.) JEFF: ... so clever. But what’s the point of being clever if you can’t prove it? (Sherlock takes out the capsule and holds it between his thumb and finger, raising it to the light to examine it more closely.) JEFF: Still the addict. (Slowly Sherlock lowers the pill again, holding it at eye level and gazing at it.) JEFF: But this ... this is what you’re really addicted to, innit? (Sherlock holds the pill in his fingers and stares at it.) JEFF: You’d do anything ... anything at all ... (Sherlock’s fingers begin to tremble with excitement and anticipation.) JEFF: ... to stop being bored. (Slowly Sherlock begins to move the pill closer to his mouth. Jeff matches the movement with his own pill towards his own mouth.) JEFF: You’re not bored now, are you? (Each of their hands gets closer to their mouths.) JEFF: Innit good? (A gunshot rings out and a bullet impacts Jeff’s chest close to his heart, continuing through his body and smashing into the door behind him. As he falls to the floor, Sherlock drops his pill in surprise. In the opposite building, John has his pistol still raised and aimed out of the window. He lowers the gun to his side. In the other building, Sherlock turns, slides over the desk behind him and hurries to the window, bending down to stare through the bullet hole in the glass. The window of the opposite room is open but there is nobody in sight. As Sherlock straightens up, Jeff breathes heavily and coughs. Sherlock turns back, looking around the room and seeing one of the pills lying on one of the desks as Jeff convulses on the floor and gasps and coughs in pain. Sherlock snatches up the pill, kneels down and brandishes it at Jeff, who has a large pool of blood underneath him and is staring up at him in shock.) SHERLOCK: Was I right? (Jeff turns his head away in disbelief.) SHERLOCK: I was, wasn’t I? Did I get it right? (Jeff doesn’t reply. Sherlock angrily hurls the pill across the room and stands up.) SHERLOCK: Okay, tell me this: your sponsor. Who was it? The one who told you about me – my ‘fan.’ I want a name. JEFF (weakly): No. SHERLOCK: You’re dying, but there’s still time to hurt you. Give me a name. (Jeff shakes his head. Grimacing angrily, Sherlock lifts his foot and puts it onto Jeff’s shoulder. Jeff gasps in pain.) SHERLOCK: A name. (Jeff cries out in pain.) SHERLOCK: Now. (Still Jeff can only whine in pain. His face intent and manic, Sherlock leans his weight onto his foot. Jeff whimpers.) SHERLOCK (furiously): The NAME! JEFF (agonised): MORIARTY! (His eyes close and his head rolls to the side. Sherlock steps back, turning his head away and looking reflective. After a few seconds, he silently mouths the word ‘Moriarty’ to himself.)  LATER. Outside the college, Sherlock is sitting on the back steps of an ambulance. A paramedic puts an orange blanket around his shoulders as Lestrade walks over. Sherlock gestures to the blanket. SHERLOCK: Why have I got this blanket? They keep putting this blanket on me. LESTRADE: Yeah, it’s for shock. SHERLOCK: I’m not in shock. LESTRADE: Yeah, but some of the guys wanna take photographs. (He grins. Sherlock rolls his eyes.) SHERLOCK: So, the shooter. No sign? LESTRADE: Cleared off before we got ’ere. But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose. One of them could have been following him but ... (he shrugs) ... got nothing to go on. (Sherlock looks at him pointedly.) SHERLOCK: Oh, I wouldn’t say that. (Now it’s Lestrade’s turn to roll his eyes.) LESTRADE: Okay, gimme. SHERLOCK (standing up): The bullet they just dug out of the wall’s from a hand gun. Kill shot over that distance from that kind of a weapon – that’s a crack shot you’re looking for, but not just a marksman; a fighter. His hands couldn’t have shaken at all, so clearly he’s acclimatised to violence. He didn’t fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You’re looking for a man probably with a history of military service ... (While he’s talking, he turns his head to look around the area and sees John standing some distance away behind the police tape.) SHERLOCK: ... and nerves of steel ... (He trails off. As John looks back at him innocently and then turns his head away, Sherlock clearly begins to realise the connection. Lestrade turns to follow Sherlock’s gaze and Sherlock turns back to him before he can start to ask questions.) SHERLOCK: Actually, do you know what? Ignore me. LESTRADE: Sorry? SHERLOCK: Ignore all of that. It’s just the, er, the shock talking. (He starts to walk towards John.) LESTRADE: Where’re you going? SHERLOCK: I just need to talk about the-the rent. LESTRADE: But I’ve still got questions for you. SHERLOCK (turning back to him in irritation): Oh, what now? I’m in shock! Look, I’ve got a blanket! (He brandishes the sides of the blanket at Lestrade as if to prove it.) LESTRADE: Sherlock! SHERLOCK: And I just caught you a serial killer ... more or less. (Lestrade looks at him thoughtfully for a moment.) LESTRADE: Okay. We’ll bring you in tomorrow. Off you go. (Sherlock walks away. Lestrade smiles as he watches him go. Taking the blanket from around his shoulders, Sherlock bundles it up as he approaches John, who is standing at the side of a police car. Sherlock tosses the blanket through the open window of the car and ducks under the police tape.) JOHN: Um, Sergeant Donovan’s just been explaining everything, the two pills. Been a dreadful business, hasn’t it? Dreadful. (Sherlock looks at him for a moment.) SHERLOCK (quietly): Good shot. JOHN (trying and utterly failing to look innocent): Yes. Yes, must have been, through that window. SHERLOCK: Well, you’d know. (John gazes up at him, still unsuccessfully trying not to let his expression give him away.) SHERLOCK: Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don’t suppose you’d serve time for this, but let’s avoid the court case. (John clears his throat and looks around nervously.) SHERLOCK: Are you all right? JOHN: Yes, of course I’m all right. SHERLOCK: Well, you have just killed a man. JOHN: Yes, I ... (He trails off. Sherlock looks at him closely.) JOHN: That’s true, innit? (He smiles. Sherlock continues to watch him carefully.) JOHN: But he wasn’t a very nice man. (Apparently reassured that John really is okay, Sherlock nods in agreement.) SHERLOCK: No. No, he wasn’t really, was he? JOHN: And frankly a bloody awful cabbie. (Sherlock chuckles, then turns and starts to lead them away.) SHERLOCK: That’s true. He was a bad cabbie. Should have seen the route he took us to get here! (John giggles, and Sherlock smiles.) JOHN: Stop! Stop, we can’t giggle, it’s a crime scene! Stop it! SHERLOCK: You’re the one who shot him. Don’t blame me. JOHN: Keep your voice down! (They’re walking past Sergeant Donovan.) JOHN (to Donovan): Sorry – it’s just, um, nerves, I think. SHERLOCK (to Donovan): Sorry. (John clears his throat as they walk away from Donovan.) JOHN: You were gonna take that damned pill, weren’t you? (Sherlock stops and turns back to him.) SHERLOCK: Course I wasn’t. Biding my time. Knew you’d turn up. JOHN: No you didn’t. It’s how you get your kicks, isn’t it? You risk your life to prove you’re clever. SHERLOCK: Why would I do that? JOHN: Because you’re an idiot. (Sherlock smiles, apparently delighted that he has finally found someone who understands him and – more to the point – doesn’t care about his behaviour. After a moment he forces the smile down.) SHERLOCK: Dinner? JOHN: Starving. (They turn and start to walk again.) SHERLOCK: End of Baker Street, there’s a good Chinese stays open ’til two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle. (As he has been speaking, a few yards ahead of them a car has pulled up and the man who abducted John earlier gets out. Not-Anthea is with him. John stares.) JOHN: Sherlock. That’s him. That’s the man I was talking to you about. (Sherlock looks across at the man.) SHERLOCK: I know exactly who that is. (He walks closer to the man and stops, looking at him angrily. John glances round to gauge where the police are in case he needs to summon their help. The man speaks pleasantly to Sherlock.) M: So, another case cracked. How very public spirited ... though that’s never really your motivation, is it? SHERLOCK: What are you doing here? M: As ever, I’m concerned about you. SHERLOCK: Yes, I’ve been hearing about your ‘concern.’ M: Always so aggressive. Did it never occur to you that you and I belong on the same side? SHERLOCK: Oddly enough, no! M: We have more in common than you like to believe. This petty feud between us is simply childish. People will suffer ... and you know how it always upset Mummy. (John frowns as if unsure of what he just heard.) SHERLOCK: I upset her? Me? (The man glowers at him.) SHERLOCK: It wasn’t me that upset her, Mycroft. JOHN: No, no, wait. Mummy? Who’s Mummy? SHERLOCK: Mother – our mother. This is my brother, Mycroft. (John stares at the man in amazement.) SHERLOCK (to Mycroft): Putting on weight again? M/MYCROFT: Losing it, in fact. JOHN (to Sherlock): He’s your brother?! SHERLOCK: Of course he’s my brother. JOHN: So he’s not ... SHERLOCK: Not what? (The brothers look at John as he shrugs in embarrassment.) JOHN: I dunno – criminal mastermind? (He grimaces at having even suggested it. Sherlock looks at Mycroft disparagingly.) SHERLOCK: Close enough. MYCROFT: For goodness’ sake. I occupy a minor position in the British government. SHERLOCK: He is the British government, when he’s not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis. (Mycroft sighs.) SHERLOCK: Good evening, Mycroft. Try not to start a war before I get home. You know what it does for the traffic. (He walks away. John starts to follow him but then turns back to Mycroft, who has turned to watch his brother.) JOHN: So, when-when you say you’re concerned about him, you actually are concerned? MYCROFT: Yes, of course. JOHN: I mean, it actually is a childish feud? MYCROFT (still watching his brother): He’s always been so resentful. You can imagine the Christmas dinners. JOHN: Yeah ... no. God, no! (He half-turns to follow Sherlock.) JOHN: I-I’d better, um ... (He turns back to not-Anthea, who has been standing nearby throughout the conversation with her eyes fixed on her BlackBerry.) JOHN: Hello again. (She looks up and smiles brightly.) NOT-ANTHEA: Hello. JOHN: Yes, we-we met earlier on this evening. (She stares at him as if she has never seen him before but is pretending that she remembers him.) NOT-ANTHEA: Oh! JOHN (somewhat exasperated): Okay, good night. (He includes Mycroft in his glance, then turns and follows after Sherlock.) MYCROFT: Good night, Doctor Watson. (John catches up to Sherlock and they walk away side by side.) JOHN: So: dim sum. SHERLOCK: Mmm! I can always predict the fortune cookies. JOHN: No you can’t. SHERLOCK: Almost can. You did get shot, though. JOHN: Sorry? SHERLOCK: In Afghanistan. There was an actual wound. JOHN: Oh, yeah. Shoulder. SHERLOCK: Shoulder! I thought so. JOHN: No you didn’t. SHERLOCK: The left one. JOHN: Lucky guess. SHERLOCK: I never guess. JOHN (laughing): Yes you do. (He looks across to Sherlock, who is smiling.) JOHN: What are you so happy about? SHERLOCK: Moriarty. JOHN: What’s Moriarty? SHERLOCK (cheerfully): I’ve absolutely no idea. (Back at the car, not-Anthea turns to Mycroft who is watching the boys as they walk away.) NOT-ANTHEA: Sir, shall we go? MYCROFT: Interesting, that soldier fellow. (Not-Anthea looks briefly at the departing boys, then turns her attention back to her BlackBerry.) MYCROFT: He could be the making of my brother – or make him worse than ever. Either way, we’d better upgrade their surveillance status. Grade Three Active. (Not-Anthea looks up from her phone.) NOT-ANTHEA: Sorry, sir. Whose status? (Mycroft intensely watches the departing men.) MYCROFT: Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. (Hero!shot as our boys walk in slow motion towards the camera before turning and smiling at each other as they mentally plan where and how many times they’re going to roger each other senseless once they get home.)  ******************  *blinks innocently* What?

SEBASTIAN, I’m glad you could make it over. We’ve had a break-in. 
SEBASTIAN, Sir William’s office – the bank’s former Chairman. The room’s been left here like a sort of memorial. Someone broke in late last night. 
JOHN, What did they steal? 
SEBASTIAN, Nothing. Just left a little message. 
SEBASTIAN, Sixty seconds apart. 
SEBASTIAN," So, someone came up here in the middle of the night, splashed paint around, then left within a minute. "
SHERLOCK, How many ways into that office? 
SEBASTIAN," Well, that’s where this gets really interesting. "
SEBASTIAN," Every door that opens in this bank, it gets logged right here. Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet. "
SHERLOCK, That door didn’t open last night. 
SEBASTIAN, There’s a hole in our security. Find it and we’ll pay you – five figures. 
SEBASTIAN," This is an advance. Tell me how he got in, there’s a bigger one on its way. "
SHERLOCK," I don’t need an incentive, Sebastian. "
JOHN," He’s, uh, he’s kidding you, obviously. "
JOHN, Sh-shall I look after that for him? 
JOHN, Thanks. 
JOHN, Two trips around the world this month. You didn’t ask his secretary; you said that just to irritate him. 
JOHN, How did you know? 
SHERLOCK, Did you see his watch? 
JOHN, His watch? 
SHERLOCK, The time was right but the date was wrong. Said two days ago. Crossed the dateline twice but he didn’t alter it. 
JOHN, Within a month? How’d you get that part? 
SHERLOCK, New Breitling. 
up on the watch showing its brand name, Breitling Chronometre Crosswind.) 
SHERLOCK, Only came out this February. 
JOHN, Okay. So d’you think we should sniff around here for a bit longer? 
SHERLOCK," Got everything I need to know already, thanks. "
JOHN, Hmm? 
SHERLOCK, That graffiti was a message for someone at the bank working on the trading floors. We find the intended recipient and ... 
JOHN, ... they’ll lead us to the person who sent it. 
SHERLOCK, Obvious. 
JOHN," Well, there’s three hundred people up there. Who was it meant for? "
SHERLOCK, Pillars. 
JOHN, What? 
SHERLOCK, Pillars and the screens. Very few places you can see that graffiti from. That narrows the field considerably. And of course the message was left at eleven thirty-four last night. That tells us a lot. 
JOHN, Does it? 
SHERLOCK, Traders come to work at all hours. Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night. That message was intended for someone who came in at midnight. 
SHERLOCK, Not many Van Coons in the phonebook. 
SHERLOCK, Taxi! 
JOHN, So what do we do now? Sit here and wait for him to come back? 
SHERLOCK, Just moved in. 
JOHN, What? 
SHERLOCK, The floor above. New label. 
JOHN, Could have just replaced it. 
SHERLOCK, No-one ever does that. 
MS WINTLE, Hello? 
SHERLOCK," Hi! Um, I live in the flat just below you. I-I don’t think we’ve met. "
SHERLOCK," Actually, I’ve just locked my keys in my flat. "
MS WINTLE, D’you want me to buzz you in? 
SHERLOCK, Yeah. And can I use your balcony? 
MS WINTLE, What? 
JOHN," D’you think he’d lost a lot of money? I mean, suicide is pretty common among City boys. "
SHERLOCK, We don’t know that it was suicide. 
JOHN, Come on. The door was locked from the inside; you had to climb down the balcony. 
SHERLOCK," Been away three days, judging by the laundry. "
SHERLOCK, Look at the case. There was something tightly packed inside it. 
JOHN, Thanks – I’ll take your word for it. 
SHERLOCK, Problem? 
JOHN," Yeah, I’m not desperate to root around some bloke’s dirty underwear. "
JOHN," What, some sort of code? "
SHERLOCK, Obviously. 
SHERLOCK," Why were they painted? If you want to communicate, why not use e-mail? "
JOHN," Well, maybe he wasn’t answering. "
SHERLOCK, Oh good. You follow. 
JOHN, No. 
SHERLOCK, What kind of a message would everyone try to avoid? 
SHERLOCK, What about this morning – those letters you were looking at? 
JOHN, Bills. 
SHERLOCK, Yes. He was being threatened. 
s VOICE, ... and see if you can get prints off this glass. 
SHERLOCK," Ah, Sergeant. We haven’t met. "
MAN," Yeah, I know who you are; and I’d prefer it if you didn’t tamper with any of the evidence. "
SHERLOCK, I’ve phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way? 
MAN, He’s busy. I’m in charge. And it’s not Sergeant; it’s Detective Inspector. Dimmock. 
DIMMOCK, We’re obviously looking at a suicide. 
JOHN, That does seem the only explanation of all the facts. 
SHERLOCK, Wrong. It’s one possible explanation of some of the facts. 
SHERLOCK," You’ve got a solution that you like, but you’re choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn’t comply with it. "
DIMMOCK, Like? 
SHERLOCK, The wound was on the right side of his head. 
DIMMOCK, And? 
SHERLOCK, Van Coon was left-handed. 
SHERLOCK, Requires quite a bit of contortion. 
DIMMOCK, Left-handed? 
SHERLOCK, Coffee table on the left-hand side; coffee mug handle pointing to the left. Power sockets: habitually used the ones on the left ... 
SHERLOCK, Pen and paper on the left-hand side of the phone because he picked it up with his right and took down messages with his left. D’you want me to go on? 
SHERLOCK," Oh, I might as well; I’m almost at the bottom of the list. "
SHERLOCK, It’s highly unlikely that a left-handed man would shoot himself in the right side of his head. 
SHERLOCK, Conclusion: someone broke in here and murdered him. Only explanation of all the facts. 
DIMMOCK, But the gun: why ... 
DIMMOCK, What? 
JOHN, Today at the bank. Sort of a warning. 
SHERLOCK, He fired a shot when his attacker came in. 
DIMMOCK, And the bullet? 
SHERLOCK, Went through the open window. 
DIMMOCK," Oh, come on! What are the chances of that?! "
SHERLOCK, Wait until you get the ballistics report. The bullet in his brain wasn’t fired from his gun. I guarantee it. 
DIMMOCK," But if his door was locked from the inside, how did the killer get in? "
SHERLOCK, It was a threat. That’s what the graffiti meant. 
SEBASTIAN, I’m kind of in a meeting. Can you make an appointment with my secretary? 
SHERLOCK," I don’t think this can wait. Sorry, Sebastian. One of your traders – someone who worked in your office – was killed. "
SEBASTIAN, What? 
JOHN, Van Coon. The police are at his flat. 
SEBASTIAN," Harrow; Oxford. Very bright guy. Worked in Asia for a while, so ... "
JOHN, ... you gave him the Hong Kong accounts. 
JOHN, Who’d wanna kill him? 
SEBASTIAN, We all make enemies. 
JOHN, You don’t all end up with a bullet through your temple. 
SEBASTIAN, Not usually. ’Scuse me. 
SEBASTIAN, It’s my Chairman. The police have been on to him. Apparently they’re telling him it was a suicide. 
SHERLOCK," Well, they’ve got it wrong, Sebastian. He was murdered. "
SEBASTIAN," Well, I’m afraid they don’t see it like that. "
SEBASTIAN, ... and neither does my boss. I hired you to do a job. Don’t get side-tracked. 
JOHN, I thought bankers were all supposed to be heartless bastards(!) 
s note," those who’ve read the early draft script of this episode which was released online some time ago may know that it was intended that the frenetic drumbeat which we hear as the man turns around was actually meant to be heard by the man. In this finished version of the episode I don’t think that’s clear, and certainly I assumed until I read the draft script that it was simply dramatic backing music. Also, unless the killer was carrying a drum around with him, or had a boombox strapped to his back, I’m not sure how it could have happened anyway ...] "
DIRECTOR, I need you to get over to Crispians. 
DIRECTOR, Two Ming vases up for auction – Chenghua. Will you appraise them? 
ANDY," Er, er, Soo Lin should go. She’s the expert. "
DIRECTOR, Soo Lin has resigned her job. I need you. 
SARAH, Just locum work. 
JOHN," No, that’s fine. "
SARAH," You’re, um ... well, you’re a bit over-qualified. "
SARAH," Well, we’ve got two away on holiday this week, and one’s just left to have a baby. Might be a bit mundane for you. "
JOHN," Er, no; mundane is good sometimes. Mundane works. "
JOHN, And a doctor. 
SARAH, Anything else you can do? 
JOHN, I learned the clarinet at school. 
SARAH," Oh! (She laughs.) Well, I look forward to it! "
JOHN, What? When? 
SHERLOCK, ’Bout an hour ago. 
JOHN," Didn’t notice I’d gone out, then. "
JOHN," Yeah, I went to see about a job at that surgery. "
SHERLOCK, How was it? 
SHERLOCK, Who? 
SHERLOCK, “She”? 
JOHN, ... It. 
SHERLOCK," Here, have a look. "
JOHN, Hmm? 
 and the article reads," An intruder who can walk through walls murdered a man in his London apartment last night. Brian Lukis, 41, a freelance journalist from Earl’s Court was found shot in his fourth floor flat but all his doors and windows were locked and there were no apparent signs of a break in. A police spokesman said they are still uncertain how the assailant broke in...) "
JOHN, The ‘intruder who can walk through walls.’ 
SHERLOCK," Happened last night. Journalist shot dead in his flat; doors locked, windows bolted from the inside – exactly the same as Van Coon. "
SHERLOCK, He’s killed another one.
SHERLOCK," Brian Lukis, freelance journalist. Murdered in his flat ... "
SHERLOCK, ... doors locked from the inside. 
JOHN," You’ve gotta admit, it’s similar. "
JOHN," Both men killed by someone who can ... (he hesitates momentarily as if unable to believe what he’s about to say, but perseveres onwards) ... walk through solid walls. "
SHERLOCK," Inspector, do you seriously believe that Eddie Van Coon was just another City suicide? "
SHERLOCK," You have seen the ballistics report, I suppose? "
SHERLOCK, And the shot that killed him: was it fired from his own gun? 
SHERLOCK, No. So this investigation might move a bit quicker if you were to take my word as gospel. 
SHERLOCK," I’ve just handed you a murder enquiry. (Louder, nodding towards the picture of Lukis on the computer) Five minutes in his flat. "
SHERLOCK, Four floors up. That’s why they think they’re safe. Put a chain across the door and bolt it shut; think they’re impregnable. 
SHERLOCK, They don’t reckon for one second that there’s another way in. 
DIMMOCK, I don’t understand. 
DIMMOCK, What are you doing? 
SHERLOCK, He clings to the walls like an insect. 
DIMMOCK, What?! 
SHERLOCK," Climbed up the side of the walls, ran along the roof, dropped in through this skylight. "
DIMMOCK, You’re not serious! Like Spiderman?(!) 
SHERLOCK," He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building, jumped the balcony to kill Van Coon. "
SHERLOCK, And of course that’s how he got into the bank. He ran along the window ledge and onto the terrace. 
SHERLOCK, We have to find out what connects these two men. 
SHERLOCK, Date stamped on the book is the same day that he died. 
JOHN, Sherlock. 
SHERLOCK," So, the killer goes to the bank, leaves a threatening cipher for Van Coon; Van Coon panics, returns to his apartment, locks himself in. "
SHERLOCK," Hours later, he dies. "
JOHN, The killer finds Lukis at the library; he writes the cipher on the shelf where he knows it’ll be seen; Lukis goes home. 
SHERLOCK," Late that night, he dies too. "
SHERLOCK, Only the cipher can tell us. 
SHERLOCK," The world’s run on codes and ciphers, John. From the million-pound security system at the bank, to the PIN machine you took exception to, cryptography inhabits our every waking moment. "
JOHN," Yes, okay, but ... "
SHERLOCK," ... but it’s all computer-generated: electronic codes, electronic ciphering methods. This is different. It’s an ancient device. Modern code-breaking methods won’t unravel it. "
JOHN, Where are we headed? 
SHERLOCK, I need to ask some advice. 
JOHN, What?! Sorry?! 
SHERLOCK, You heard me perfectly. I’m not saying it again. 
JOHN, You need advice? 
SHERLOCK," On painting, yes. I need to talk to an expert. "
RAZ, Part of a new exhibition. 
RAZ, I call it Urban Bloodlust Frenzy. 
JOHN, Catchy(!) 
RAZ, Can we do this while I’m workin’? 
SHERLOCK, Know the author? 
RAZ, Recognise the paint. It’s like Michigan; hardcore propellant. I’d say zinc. 
SHERLOCK, What about the symbols: d’you recognise them? 
SHERLOCK," Two men have been murdered, Raz. Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them. "
RAZ," What, and this is all you’ve got to go on? It’s hardly much, now, is it? "
SHERLOCK, Are you gonna help us or not? 
RAZ, I’ll ask around. 
SHERLOCK, Somebody must know something about it. 
COMMUNITY OFFICER, What the hell do you think you’re doing? This gallery is a listed public building. 
JOHN," No, no, wait, wait. It’s not me who painted that. "
JOHN, I was just holding this for ... 
COMMUNITY OFFICER," Bit of an enthusiast, are we? "
ANDY, She was right in the middle of an important piece of restoration. Why would she suddenly resign? 
DIRECTOR, Family problems. She said so in her letter. 
ANDY, But she doesn’t have a family. She came to this country on her own. 
DIRECTOR, Andy ... 
ANDY," Look, those teapots, those ceramics: they’ve become her obsession. She’s been working on restoring them for weeks. I-I can’t believe that she would just abandon them. "
DIRECTOR, Perhaps she was getting a bit of unwanted attention. 
JOHN," Just formalities: fingerprints, charge sheet; and I’ve gotta be in Magistrates Court on Tuesday. "
 This symbol, I still can’t place it. 
SHERLOCK," No, I need you to go to the police station ... "
SHERLOCK, ... ask about the journalist. 
SHERLOCK," Gonna go and see Van Coon’s P.A. If we retrace their steps, somewhere they’ll coincide. "
JOHN, Scotland Yard. 
TAXI DRIVER, Right. 
AMANDA, Flew back from Dalian Friday. Looks like he had back-to-back meetings with the sales team. 
SHERLOCK, Can you print me up a copy? 
AMANDA, Sure. 
SHERLOCK, What about the day he died? Can you tell me where he was? 
AMANDA, I have all his receipts. 
DIMMOCK, Your friend ... 
JOHN," Listen: whatever you say, I’m behind you one hundred percent. "
DIMMOCK, ... he’s an arrogant sod. 
JOHN," Well, that was mild! People say a lot worse than that. "
DIMMOCK," This is what you wanted, isn’t it? The journalist’s diary? "
SHERLOCK," What kind of a boss was he, Amanda? Appreciative? "
AMANDA," Um, no. That’s not a word I’d use. The only things Eddie appreciated had a big price tag. "
SHERLOCK," Like that hand cream. He bought that for you, didn’t he? "
SHERLOCK, Look at this one. Got a taxi from home on the day he died. Eighteen pounds fifty. 
AMANDA, That would get him to the office. 
SHERLOCK, Not rush hour; check the time. Mid-morning. Eighteen would get him as far as ... 
AMANDA, The West End. I remember him saying. 
SHERLOCK, Underground. Printed at one in Piccadilly. 
AMANDA, So he got a Tube back to the office. Why would he get a taxi into town and then the Tube back? 
AMANDA, Delivering? 
SHERLOCK," To somewhere near Piccadilly Station. Dropped the package, delivered it and then ... "
SHERLOCK, ... stopped on his way. He got peckish. 
SHERLOCK," So you bought your lunch from here en route to the station, but where were you headed from? Where did the taxi drop you ...? "
JOHN, Right. 
JOHN, Sherlock ... 
SHERLOCK," ... credit card bills, receipts. He flew back from China, then he came here. "
JOHN, Sherlock ... 
SHERLOCK," Somewhere in this street; somewhere near. I don’t know where, but ... "
SHERLOCK, How can you tell? 
JOHN, Lukis’ diary. (He shows Sherlock the entry.) He was here too. He wrote down the address. 
SHERLOCK, Oh. 
 JOHN, Hello. 
SHOP KEEPER, You want lucky cat? 
JOHN," No, thanks. No. "
SHOP KEEPER, Ten pound. Ten pound! 
JOHN, No. 
SHOP KEEPER," I think your wife, she will like! "
JOHN," No, thank you. "
JOHN, Sherlock. 
JOHN, The label there. 
SHERLOCK," Yes, I see it. "
JOHN, Exactly the same as the cipher. 
SHERLOCK, It’s an ancient number system! Hangzhou. 
SHERLOCK," These days, only street traders use it. Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library. "
SHERLOCK, Numbers written in an ancient Chinese dialect. 
JOHN, It’s a fifteen! What we thought was the artist’s tag – it’s a number fifteen. 
SHERLOCK, And the blindfold – the horizontal line? That was a number as well. 
JOHN, We’ve found it! 
JOHN, Two men travel back from China. Both head straight for the Lucky Cat emporium. What did they see? 
SHERLOCK, It’s not what they saw; it’s what they both brought back in those suitcases. 
JOHN, And you don’t mean duty free. 
JOHN, Thank you. 
SHERLOCK, Think about what Sebastian told us; about Van Coon – about how he stayed afloat in the market. 
JOHN, Lost five million ... 
SHERLOCK, ... made it back in a week. 
JOHN, Mmm. 
SHERLOCK, That’s how he made such easy money. 
JOHN, He was a smuggler. Mmm. 
SHERLOCK, A guy like him – it would have been perfect. 
SHERLOCK, Business man ... 
JOHN, Mmm-hmm. 
SHERLOCK, ... making frequent trips to Asia. And Lukis was the same ... 
SHERLOCK, ... a journalist writing about China. 
JOHN, Mmm. 
SHERLOCK," Both of them smuggled stuff out, and the Lucky Cat was their drop-off. "
JOHN," But why did they die? I mean, it doesn’t make sense. If they both turn up at the shop and deliver the goods, why would someone threaten them and kill them after the event, after they’d finished the job? "
SHERLOCK, What if one of them was light-fingered? 
JOHN, How d’you mean? 
SHERLOCK, Stole something; something from the hoard. 
JOHN," And the killer doesn’t know which of them took it, so he threatens them both. Right. "
SHERLOCK, Remind me ... 
SHERLOCK, ... when was the last time that it rained? 
SHERLOCK, It’s been here since Monday. 
SHERLOCK, No-one’s been in that flat for at least three days. 
JOHN, Could’ve gone on holiday. 
SHERLOCK, D’you leave your windows open when you go on holiday? 
JOHN, Sherlock! 
SHERLOCK, Someone else has been here. 
SHERLOCK, Somebody else broke into the flat and knocked over the vase just like I did. 
JOHN," Can you not keep doing this, please? "
SHERLOCK, I’m not the first. 
JOHN, What? 
JOHN, What are you saying? 
JOHN, I’m wasting my breath. 
SHERLOCK, Our acrobat. 
SHERLOCK, But why didn’t he close the window when he left ...? 
SHERLOCK," Oh, stupid. Stupid. Obvious. He’s still here. "
JOHN, Any time you want to include me. 
JOHN, “... my MASSIVE INTELLECT!” 
SHERLOCK," The, uh, milk’s gone off and the washing’s starting to smell. Somebody left here in a hurry three days ago. "
JOHN, Somebody? 
JOHN," But how, exactly? "
 On the back of it is written, 
 Printed in the bottom right hand corner is, 
JOHN, You’ve gone all croaky. Are you getting a cold? 
SHERLOCK, When was the last time that you saw her? 
ANDY," Three days ago, um, here at the museum. "
ANDY, This morning they told me she’d resigned just like that. 
ANDY, Just left her work unfinished. 
ANDY, She does this demonstration for the tourists – a-a tea ceremony. So she would have packed up her things and just put them in here. 
SHERLOCK, We have to get to Soo Lin Yao. 
JOHN, If she’s still alive. 
RAZ, Sherlock! 
JOHN," Oh, look who it is. "
JOHN," Tuesday morning, all you’ve gotta do is turn up and say the bag was yours. "
SHERLOCK, Forget about your court date. 
GIRL," Dude, that was rad! "
SHERLOCK," If you want to hide a tree, then a forest is the best place to do it, wouldn’t you say? People would just walk straight past, not knowing, unable to decipher the message. "
RAZ, There. I spotted it earlier. 
SHERLOCK, They have been in here. (To Raz) And that’s the exact same paint? 
RAZ, Yeah. 
SHERLOCK," John, if we’re going to decipher this code, we’re gonna need to look for more evidence. "
JOHN, It’s been painted over! 
JOHN, I don’t understand. It-it was here ... (he stumbles backwards) ... ten minutes ago. I saw it. A whole load of graffiti! 
SHERLOCK, Somebody doesn’t want me to see it. 
JOHN," Hey, Sherlock, what are you doing ...? "
SHERLOCK," Shh, John, concentrate. I need you to concentrate. Close your eyes. "
JOHN," No, what? Why? Why? "
JOHN, What are you doing?! 
SHERLOCK, I need you to maximise your visual memory. Try to picture what you saw. Can you picture it? 
JOHN, Yeah. 
SHERLOCK, Can you remember it? 
JOHN," Yes, definitely. "
SHERLOCK, Can you remember the pattern? 
JOHN, Yes! 
SHERLOCK, How much can you remember it? 
JOHN," Well, don’t worry ... "
JOHN," Yeah, well, don’t worry – I remember all of it. "
JOHN," Yeah, well at least I would ... (he pulls himself free) ... if I can get to my pockets! "
JOHN, I took a photograph. 
SHERLOCK," Always in pairs, John. "
JOHN, Hmm? 
SHERLOCK, Numbers come with partners. 
SHERLOCK, Why did he paint it so near the tracks? 
SHERLOCK, Thousands of people pass by there every day. 
SHERLOCK," Of course! He wants information. He’s trying to communicate with his people in the underworld. Whatever was stolen, he wants it back. "
SHERLOCK, Somewhere here in the code. 
SHERLOCK, We can’t crack this without Soo Lin Yao. 
JOHN," Oh, good(!) "
SHERLOCK," Two men who travelled back from China were murdered, and their killer left them messages in the Hangzhou numerals. "
JOHN," Soo Lin Yao’s in danger. Now, that cipher – it was just the same pattern as the others. He means to kill her as well. "
ANDY," Look, I’ve tried everywhere: um, friends, colleagues. I-I don’t know where she’s gone. I mean, she could be a thousand miles away. "
JOHN, What are you looking at? 
ANDY," Th-the pots were her obsession. Um, they need urgent work. If-if they dry out, then the clay can start to crumble. Apparently you have to just keep making tea in them. "
SHERLOCK," Yesterday, only one of those pots was shining. Now there are two. "
SHERLOCK, Fancy a biscuit with that? 
SHERLOCK, Centuries old. Don’t wanna break that. 
SHERLOCK, Hello.
SOO LIN, You saw the cipher. Then you know he is coming for me. 
SHERLOCK, You’ve been clever to avoid him so far. 
SOO LIN, I had to finish ... to finish this work. It’s only a matter of time. I know he will find me. 
SHERLOCK, Who is he? Have you met him before? 
SHERLOCK, The cipher. 
SOO LIN, Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu. 
JOHN, Zhi Zhu? 
SHERLOCK, The Spider. 
SOO LIN, You know this mark? 
SHERLOCK, Yes. It’s the mark of a Tong. 
JOHN, Hmm? 
SHERLOCK, Ancient crime syndicate based in China. 
SOO LIN, Every foot soldier bears the mark; everyone who hauls for them. 
JOHN, “Hauls”? 
JOHN, Y-you mean you were a smuggler? 
SOO LIN, I was fifteen. My parents were dead. I had no livelihood; no way of surviving day to day except to work for the bosses. 
SHERLOCK, Who are they? 
SOO LIN," They are called the Black Lotus. By the time I was sixteen, I was taking thousands of pounds’ worth of drugs across the border into Hong Kong. But I managed to leave that life behind me. I came to England. "
SOO LIN, They gave me a job here. Everything was good; a new life. 
SHERLOCK, Then he came looking for you. 
SOO LIN, Yes. 
SOO LIN," I had hoped after five years maybe they would have forgotten me, but they never really let you leave. A small community like ours – they are never very far away. "
SOO LIN, He came to my flat. He asked me to help him to track down something that was stolen. 
JOHN, And you’ve no idea what it was? 
SOO LIN, I refused to help. 
SOO LIN, Oh yes. 
SOO LIN, He’s my brother. 
SOO LIN," Two orphans. We had no choice. We could work for the Black Lotus, or starve on the streets like beggars. "
SOO LIN," My brother has become their puppet, in the power of the one they call Shan – the Black Lotus general. "
SOO LIN, I turned my brother away. He said I had betrayed him. Next day I came to work and the cipher was waiting. 
SHERLOCK, Can you decipher these? 
SOO LIN, These are numbers. 
SHERLOCK," Yes, I know. "
 Here, the line across the man’s eyes – it’s the Chinese number one. 
SOO LIN, All the smugglers know it. It’s based upon a book ... 
JOHN," Sh-Sherlock. Sherlock, wait! "
JOHN, Come here. 
JOHN, Get in. Get in! 
JOHN, I have to go and help. Bolt the door after me. 
SHERLOCK, Thank you(!) 
SOO LIN, 亮 [Liang.] 
SOO LIN, 大哥 [Big brother.] 
SOO LIN, 请你 [Please ...] 
JOHN, Oh my God. 
JOHN, How many murders is it gonna take before you start believing that this maniac’s out there? 
JOHN, A young girl was gunned down tonight. That’s three victims in three days. You’re supposed to be finding him. 
SHERLOCK, Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon were working for a gang of international smugglers – a gang called the Black Lotus operating here in London right under your nose. 
DIMMOCK, Can you prove that? 
SHERLOCK, What are you thinking: pork or the pasta? 
MOLLY," Oh, it’s you! "
SHERLOCK," This place is never going to trouble Egon Ronay, is it? "
SHERLOCK, I’d stick with the pasta. Don’t wanna be doing roast pork – not if you’re slicing up cadavers. 
MOLLY, What are you having? 
SHERLOCK, Don’t eat when I’m working. Digesting slows me down. 
MOLLY, So you’re working here tonight? 
SHERLOCK, Need to examine some bodies. 
MOLLY, “Some”? 
SHERLOCK, Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis. 
SHERLOCK, Could you wheel them out again for me? 
SHERLOCK, You’ve ... changed your hair. 
SHERLOCK, The-the style: it’s usually parted in the middle. 
MOLLY," Yes, well ... "
SHERLOCK," Mmm, it’s good; it, um, suits you better this way. "
SHERLOCK, We’re just interested in the feet. 
SHERLOCK, Yes. D’you mind if we have a look at them? 
SHERLOCK, Now Van Coon. 
SHERLOCK, Oh(!) 
SHERLOCK, So either these two men just happened to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour or I’m telling the truth. 
SHERLOCK, I want every book from Lukis’ apartment and Van Coon’s. 
DIMMOCK, Their books? 
SHERLOCK, Not just a criminal organisation; it’s a cult. Her brother was corrupted by one of its leaders. 
JOHN, Soo Lin said the name. 
SHERLOCK," Yes, Shan; General Shan. "
JOHN, We’re still no closer to finding them. 
SHERLOCK, Wrong. We’ve got almost all we need to know. She gave us most of the missing pieces. 
SHERLOCK, Why did he need to visit his sister? Why did he need her expertise? 
JOHN, She worked at the museum. 
SHERLOCK, Exactly. 
SHERLOCK," Valuable antiquities, John. Ancient Chinese relics purchased on the black market. China’s home to a thousand treasures hidden after Mao’s revolution. "
JOHN, And the Black Lotus is selling them. 
SHERLOCK," Here, John. "
JOHN, Mmm. 
SHERLOCK, Arrived from China four days ago. 
SHERLOCK, Anonymous. Vendor doesn’t give his name. Two undiscovered treasures from the East. 
JOHN, One in Lukis’ suitcase and one in Van Coon’s. 
SHERLOCK, ... antiquities sold at auction. 
SHERLOCK," Look, here’s another one. "
JOHN, Mmm. 
SHERLOCK," Arrived from China a month ago: Chinese ceramic statue, sold four hundred thousand. "
 look," a month before that – a Chinese painting, half a million. "
SHERLOCK, All of them from an anonymous source. They’re stealing them back in China and one by one they’re feeding them into Britain. 
JOHN, Huh. 
JOHN, And every single auction coincides with Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China. 
SHERLOCK, So what if one of them got greedy when they were in China? What if one of them stole something? 
JOHN, That’s why Zhi Zhu’s come. 
MRS HUDSON, Ooh-ooh! 
MRS HUDSON," Sorry. Are we collecting for charity, Sherlock? "
SHERLOCK, What? 
MRS HUDSON, A young man’s outside with crates of books. 
SHERLOCK," So, the numbers are references. "
JOHN, To books. 
SHERLOCK, To specific pages and specific words on those pages. 
JOHN," Right, so ... fifteen and one: that means ... "
SHERLOCK, Turn to page fifteen and it’s the first word you read. 
JOHN, Okay. So what’s the message? 
JOHN," Okay, right. Well, this shouldn’t take too long, should it?(!) "
DIMMOCK," We found these, at the museum. "
DIMMOCK, Is this your writing? 
DIMMOCK," Anything else I can do? To assist you, I mean? "
SHERLOCK, “Cigarette.” 
JOHN, Ah. 
SHERLOCK, “Imagine.” 
RECEPTIONIST, I’m sorry to keep you waiting. 
RECEPTIONIST, But we haven’t got anything now ’til next Thursday. 
RECEPTIONIST," Er, sorry. "
SARAH, Let me go and have a word. 
RECEPTIONIST," Yeah, thanks. "
SARAH, John? 
SARAH, John? 
JOHN," Um, looks like I’m done. I thought I had some more to see. "
SARAH," Oh, I did one or two of yours. "
JOHN, One or two? 
SARAH," Well, maybe five or six. "
JOHN, I’m sorry. That’s not very professional. 
SARAH," No. No, not really. "
JOHN," I had, um, a bit of a late one. "
SARAH," Oh, right. "
JOHN," Anyway, see you. "
SARAH," So, um, what were you doing to keep you up so late? "
SARAH," Oh. Oh, she likes books, does she, your ... your girlfriend? "
JOHN," Mmm? No, it wasn’t a date. "
JOHN, And I don’t have one tonight. 
SHERLOCK, A book that everybody would own. 
SHERLOCK, Fifteen. Entry one. 
SHERLOCK, I need to get some air. We’re going out tonight. 
JOHN," Actually, I’ve, er, got a date. "
SHERLOCK, What? 
JOHN, It’s where two people who like each other go out and have fun. 
SHERLOCK, That’s what I was suggesting. 
JOHN, No it wasn’t ... at least I hope not. 
JOHN," Er, cinema. "
SHERLOCK," Oh, dull, boring, predictable. "
SHERLOCK, Why don’t you try this? 
SHERLOCK, In London for one night only. 
JOHN," Thanks, but I don’t come to you for dating advice. "
SARAH, It’s years since anyone took me to the circus. 
SARAH," Ah. What are they, a touring company or something? "
JOHN, I don’t know much about it. 
SARAH, I think they’re probably from China! 
JOHN," Yes, I think ... I think so, yes. (Quietly) There’s a coincidence(!) "
CUSTOMER, That’s wonderful. Thank you very much. 
MANAGER, Okay. 
JOHN," Hi. I have, er, two tickets reserved for tonight. "
MANAGER, And what’s the name? 
MANAGER," Actually, I have three in that name. "
JOHN," No, I don’t think so. We only booked two. "
SHERLOCK, I’m Sherlock. 
SARAH," Er, hi. "
SHERLOCK, Hello. 
JOHN, You couldn’t let me have just one night off? 
SHERLOCK," Yellow Dragon Circus, in London for one day. It fits. The Tong sent an assassin to England ... "
JOHN," ... dressed as a tightrope walker. Come on, Sherlock, behave! "
SHERLOCK," We’re looking for a killer who can climb, who can shin up a rope. Where else would you find that level of dexterity? Exit visas are scarce in China. They need a pretty good reason to get out of that country. Now, all I need to do is have a quick look round the place ... "
JOHN, Fine. You do that; I’m gonna take Sarah for a pint. 
JOHN, I do have a couple of other things on my mind this evening! 
SHERLOCK, Like what? 
JOHN, You are kidding. 
SHERLOCK, What’s so important? 
JOHN," Sherlock, I’m right in the middle of a date. D’you want me to chase some killer while I’m trying to ... "
SHERLOCK, What? 
JOHN, Heyyy. 
SARAH, Yeah! 
 it seems that the stage is not going to be used," a circle of candles has been laid out in the middle of the floor, about thirty feet in diameter. The room is dimly lit. The patrons are gathering around the circle but there are no seats. Apparently the number of tickets has been limited and there’s room for everyone to stand around the circle with a clear view. Sarah and John stand side by side while Sherlock stands behind them with his back to them, looking all around the room and peering up to the ceiling. John talks quietly over his shoulder to his flatmate, turning his head away from Sarah so that she can’t hear. "
JOHN," You said circus. This is not a circus. Look at the size of this crowd. Sherlock, this is ... (he grimaces with distaste) ... art. "
JOHN," No, sorry, I forgot. They’re not a circus; they’re a gang of international smugglers. "
JOHN, Hmm? 
SHERLOCK, The crossbow’s on a delicate string. The warrior has to escape his bonds before it fires. 
SARAH," Oh, Gawd! I’m sorry! "
SARAH, Thank God. 
JOHN, My God! 
OPERA SINGER," Ladies and gentlemen, from the distant moonlight shores of the Yangtze River, we present for your pleasure the deadly Chinese bird-spider. "
SHERLOCK, Come on! Let’s go! 
DIMMOCK, I sent a couple of cars. The old hall is totally deserted. 
SHERLOCK," Look, I saw the mark at the circus – that tattoo that we saw on the two bodies: the mark of the Tong. "
JOHN," Lukis and Van Coon were part of a-a smuggling operation. Now, one of them stole something when they were in China; something valuable. "
SHERLOCK, These circus performers were gang members sent here to get it back. 
DIMMOCK, Get what back? 
DIMMOCK, You don’t know. 
DIMMOCK, Mr Holmes ... 
DIMMOCK," I’ve done everything you asked. Lestrade, he seems to think your advice is worth something. "
DIMMOCK, I gave the order for a raid. Please tell me I’ll have something to show for it – other than a massive bill for overtime.
JOHN, They’ll be back in China by tomorrow. 
SHERLOCK," No, they won’t leave without what they came for. We need to find their hide-out; the rendezvous. "
SHERLOCK, Somewhere in this message it must tell us. 
SARAH," Well, I think perhaps I should leave you to it. "
JOHN," No, no, you don’t have to go ... (he looks round at Sherlock) ... does she? (He turns back to Sarah.) You can stay. "
JOHN, He’s kidding. Please stay if you’d like. 
SARAH," Is it just me, or is anyone else starving? "
SARAH," So this is what you do, you and John. You solve puzzles for a living. "
SARAH, Oh. 
JOHN, Oh! 
SARAH, What are these squiggles? 
SARAH," Oh, right! Yeah, well, of course I should have known that(!) "
MRS HUDSON, Ooh-ooh! 
SARAH, And each pair of numbers is a word. 
SHERLOCK, How did you know that? 
SARAH," Well, two words have already been translated, here. "
SHERLOCK, John. 
JOHN, Mmm? 
SHERLOCK, Soo Lin at the museum – she started to translate the code for us. We didn’t see it! 
SHERLOCK," “NINE,” “MILL.” "
SHERLOCK, We need to know the end of this sentence. 
JOHN, Where are you going? 
SHERLOCK," Oh, we must have been staring right at it! "
JOHN, At-at what? 
SHERLOCK," The book, John. The book – the key to cracking the cipher! "
SHERLOCK," Soo Lin used it to do this! Whilst we were running around the gallery, she started to translate the code. It must be on her desk. "
SHERLOCK, Taxi! 
TOURIST," Hey, du! Siehst du nicht wo du hingehst? [Hey, you! Why don’t you look where you’re going?] "
SHERLOCK," Entschuldigen Sie, bitte. [Forgive me, please.] "
TOURIST," Und dann sagen die, dass die Engländer höflich sind! [And they say the English are polite!] "
MALE TOURIST," Was wollt er? Was will er? [{Anarion says that the first sentence makes no sense at all, but the second sentence translates to:} What does he want?] "
TOURIST," Hey, du! Was macht du? [Hey, you! What are you doing?] "
SARAH," Yeah! No, absolutely. I mean, well, a quiet night in’s just-just what the doctor ordered. "
SARAH," Er, I mean, I’d love to go out of an evening and wrestle a few Chinese gangsters, you know, generally, but a girl can get too much. "
JOHN," No, okay. "
JOHN," Hmm. Um, shall we get a takeaway? "
SARAH, Yeah! 
SHERLOCK," Page fifteen, entry one. Page fifteen, entry one ... "
SHERLOCK, Dead man. You were threatening to kill them. 
SHERLOCK, It’s the first cipher. 
SHERLOCK," Thirty-seven, nine; thirty-seven, nine ... "
SHERLOCK, Nine mill ... for ... 
JOHN," Ooh, blimey, that was quick. I’ll just pop down. "
SARAH, Do you want me to lay the table? 
JOHN," Um, eat off trays? "
SARAH, Yeah. 
JOHN, Yeah! 
SHERLOCK," Sixty, thirty-five. "
SHERLOCK, Jade. (He writes on the photograph as he says the word again.) Jade. 
JOHN, Sorry to keep you. (Rummaging in his trouser pocket) How much d’you want? 
CHINESE MAN, Do you have it? 
CHINESE MAN, Do you have the treasure? 
JOHN, I don’t understand. 
SHERLOCK, “NINE MILL FOR JADE PIN DRAGON DEN BLACK ... (he raises his head and stares ahead of him) ... TRAMWAY.” 
SHERLOCK, John! John! I’ve got it! 
SHERLOCK, The cipher! The book! It’s the London A to Z that they’re using... 
OPERA SINGER, “A book is like a magic garden carried in your pocket.” 
OPERA SINGER," Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes. "
JOHN, I ... I’m not Sherlock Holmes. 
JOHN, Ow. Ow. 
OPERA SINGER," Debit card, name of S. Holmes. "
JOHN, Yes; that’s not actually mine. He lent that to me. 
JOHN," Yeah, he gave me that to look after. "
JOHN," Yes, okay ... "
OPERA SINGER, We heard it from your own mouth. 
JOHN, What? 
OPERA SINGER, “I am Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone ...” 
JOHN, Did I really say that? 
JOHN, I s’ppose there’s no use me trying to persuade you I was doing an impression. 
OPERA SINGER, I am Shan. 
JOHN, You’re ... you’re Shan. 
SHAN," Three times we tried to kill you and your companion, Mr Holmes. What does it tell you when an assassin cannot shoot straight? "
SHAN, It tells you that they’re not really trying. 
SHERLOCK, Tramway. 
SHERLOCK, There. 
SHAN, Not blank bullets now. 
SHAN," If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes, we would have done it by now. We just wanted to make you inquisitive. "
SHAN, Do you have it? 
JOHN, Do I have what? 
SHAN, The treasure. 
JOHN, I don’t know what you’re talking about. 
SHAN, Everything in the West has its price; and the price for her life ... 
SHAN, ... information. 
SHAN, Where’s the hairpin? 
SHAN," The Empress pin valued at nine million sterling. We already had a buyer in the West; and then one of our people was greedy. He took it, brought it back to London and you, Mr Holmes, have been searching. "
JOHN," Please. Please, listen to me. I’m not ... I’m not Sherlock Holmes. You have to believe me. I haven’t found whatever it is you’re looking for. "
SHAN," Ladies and gentlemen. From the distant moonlit shores of NW1, we present for your pleasure Sherlock Holmes’ pretty companion in a death-defying act. "
JOHN, Please! 
SHAN, You’ve seen the act before. How dull for you. You know how it ends. 
SHAN, I don’t believe you. 
SHERLOCK, Sherlock Holmes is nothing at all like him. 
JOHN, Don’t worry. Next date won’t be like this. 
SHERLOCK, We’ll just slip off. No need to mention us in your report. 
DIMMOCK, Mr Holmes ... 
SHERLOCK," I have high hopes for you, Inspector. A glittering career. "
DIMMOCK, I go where you point me. 
JOHN, Ta. 
JOHN," So, “Nine mill ...” "
JOHN," Million, yes; “Nine million for jade pin. Dragon den, black Tramway.” "
SHERLOCK, An instruction to all their London operatives. 
JOHN, Mmm. 
SHERLOCK, A message; what they were trying to reclaim. 
JOHN," What, a jade pin? "
SHERLOCK," Worth nine million pounds. Bring it to the Tramway, their London hideout. "
JOHN, Hang on: a hairpin worth nine million pounds? 
SHERLOCK, Apparently. 
JOHN, Why so much? 
SHERLOCK, Depends who owned it. 
SHERLOCK, Two operatives based in London. They travel over to Dalian to smuggle those vases. One of them helps himself to something: a little hairpin. 
JOHN, Worth nine million pounds. 
SHERLOCK, Eddie Van Coon was the thief. He stole the treasure when he was in China. 
JOHN," How d’you know it was Van Coon, not Lukis? Even the killer didn’t know that. "
AMANDA, Amanda. 
AMANDA, Oh. Hello. 
AMANDA, How do you know that? 
SHERLOCK, No. 
AMANDA, Then I don’t understand. Why ...? 
SHERLOCK, Three hundred millilitres of it. Bottle almost finished. 
SHERLOCK, I don’t think Eddie Van Coon was the type of chap to buy himself hand soap – not unless he had a lady coming over. And it’s the same brand as that hand cream there on your desk. 
AMANDA," Look, it wasn’t serious between us. It was over in a flash. It couldn’t last – he was my boss. "
SHERLOCK, What happened? Why did you end it? 
SHERLOCK, And he brought you a present from abroad to say sorry. 
SHERLOCK, Can I ... just have a look at it? 
SEBASTIAN, He really climbed up onto the balcony? 
JOHN, Nail a plank across the window and all your problems are over. 
JOHN, Thanks. 
AMANDA, Said he bought it in a street market. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, I don’t think that’s true. I think he pinched it. "
SHERLOCK, Didn’t know its value; just thought it would suit you. 
AMANDA, Oh? What’s it worth? 
AMANDA, Oh my God! 
AMANDA, Oh my G... 
JOHN, Over a thousand years old and it’s sitting on her bedside table every night. 
SHERLOCK, He didn’t know its value; didn’t know why they were chasing him. 
JOHN, Hmm. Should’ve just got her a lucky cat. 
SHERLOCK, Hmm. 
JOHN," You mind, don’t you? "
JOHN, That she escaped – General Shan. It’s not enough that we got her two henchmen. 
SHERLOCK," It must be a vast network, John; thousands of operatives. You and I, we barely scratched the surface. "
JOHN," You cracked the code, though, Sherlock; and maybe Dimmock can track down all of them now that he knows it. "
SHERLOCK, No. No. I cracked this code; all the smugglers have to do is pick up another book. 
SHAN, Without you – without your assistance – we would not have found passage into London. You have my thanks. 
s response appears typed on the screen, 
M, GRATITUDE IS MEANINGLESS 
M, IT IS ONLY THE EXPECTATION OF FURTHER FAVOURS 
SHAN, We did not anticipate ... we did not know this man would come – this Sherlock Holmes. 
SHAN, And now your safety is compromised. 
The computer beeps and new text appears, 
M, THEY CANNOT TRACE THIS BACK TO ME 
M, I AM CERTAIN. 
SHERLOCK," Just tell me what happened, from the beginning. "
BERWICK," We’d been to a bar – a nice place – and, er, I got chattin’ with one of the waitresses, and Karen weren’t ’appy with that, so ... when we get back to the ’otel, we end up havin’ a bit of a ding-dong, don’t we? "
BERWICK," She was always gettin’ at me, sayin’ I weren’t a real man. "
SHERLOCK, Wasn’t a real man. 
BERWICK, What? 
SHERLOCK, It’s not “weren’t”; it’s “wasn’t.” 
BERWICK, Oh. 
SHERLOCK, Go on. 
BERWICK," Well, then I dunno how it happened, but suddenly there’s a knife in my hands. And, you know, me old man was a butcher, so I know how to handle knives. "
BERWICK, He learned us how to cut up a beast. 
SHERLOCK, “Taught.” 
SHERLOCK, Taught you how to cut up a beast. 
BERWICK," Yeah, well, then-then I done it. "
SHERLOCK, “Did it.” 
BERWICK, ... wasn’t movin’ no more. 
BERWICK, ... any more. 
BERWICK," You’ve gotta help me, Mr Holmes! "
BERWICK," Everyone says you’re the best. Without you, I’ll get hung for this. "
SHERLOCK," No, no, no, Mr Berwick, not at all. "
SHERLOCK," Hanged, yes. "
JOHN, What the hell are you doing? 
JOHN, No ... 
JOHN, So you take it out on the wall. 
SHERLOCK, Belarus. Open and shut domestic murder. Not worth my time. 
JOHN, Anything in? I’m starving. 
JOHN," Oh, f... "
JOHN, It’s a head. 
JOHN, A severed head! 
SHERLOCK," Just tea for me, thanks. "
JOHN, A bloody head! 
SHERLOCK, I got it from Bart’s morgue. 
SHERLOCK, I’m measuring the coagulation of saliva after death. 
SHERLOCK, I see you’ve written up the taxi driver case. 
SHERLOCK, “A Study in Pink.” Nice(!) 
JOHN," Well, you know, pink lady, pink case, pink phone – there was a lot of pink. Did you like it? "
SHERLOCK," Erm, no. "
JOHN, Why not? I thought you’d be flattered. 
JOHN, Now hang on a minute. I didn’t mean that in a ... 
SHERLOCK, ... or who’s sleeping with who ... 
SHERLOCK, Not that again. It’s not important. 
JOHN, Not impor... 
JOHN, It’s primary school stuff. How can you not know that? 
JOHN, “Deleted it”? 
SHERLOCK," Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish, and that makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters. Do you see? "
JOHN, But it’s the solar system! 
SHERLOCK," Oh, hell! What does that matter?! "
SHERLOCK," So we go round the Sun! If we went round the Moon, or round and round the garden like a teddy bear ... (he flails his hands around beside his head while narrating the line from the childen’s poem) ... it wouldn’t make any difference. All that matters to me is the work. Without that, my brain rots. "
SHERLOCK," Put that in your blog. Or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world. "
JOHN," ’Scuse me, Mrs ... "
MRS HUDSON," Oh, sorry, love! "
JOHN, Sorry. 
MRS HUDSON, Ooh-ooh! 
MRS HUDSON, Have you two had a little domestic? 
MRS HUDSON," Ooh, it’s a bit nippy out there. He should have wrapped himself up a bit more. "
SHERLOCK," Look at that, Mrs Hudson. (He scans the street.) Quiet, calm, peaceful. (He grimaces and drags in a long breath.) Isn’t it hateful? "
MRS HUDSON," Oh, I’m sure something’ll turn up, Sherlock. A nice murder – that’ll cheer you up. "
SARAH, Morning! 
JOHN," Oh, mor... (He turns to look at her but grimaces again and grabs at his neck in pain.) Morning. "
SARAH, See? Told you you should’ve gone with the lilo. 
SARAH," Well, maybe next time I’ll let you kip at the end of my bed, you know. "
JOHN, Love some. 
SARAH," Yeah, well you’d better make it yourself, ’cause I’m gonna have a shower! "
JOHN, Sarah! 
JOHN, Sarah! 
JOHN, Sorry – I’ve got to run. 
JOHN," ’Scuse me, can I get through? ’Scuse me. "
JOHN, Can I go through? 
JOHN, I live over there. 
JOHN, Sherlock. Sherlock! 
SHERLOCK," Hmm? What? (He looks around at the mess of broken glass and scattered paperwork as if he has forgotten it – which he probably has.) Oh, yeah. Fine. Gas leak, apparently. "
SHERLOCK, I can’t. 
MYCROFT, “Can’t”? 
SHERLOCK, The stuff I’ve got on is just too big. I can’t spare the time. 
MYCROFT, Never mind your usual trivia. This is of national importance. 
MYCROFT, I’m afraid my brother can be very intransigent. 
SHERLOCK," If you’re so keen, why don’t you investigate it? "
MYCROFT, No-no-no-no-no. I can’t possibly be away from the office for any length of time – not with the Korean elections so ... 
MYCROFT," Well, you don’t need to know about that, do you? "
MYCROFT," Besides, a case like this – it requires ... (he grimaces in distaste) ... legwork. "
SHERLOCK," How’s Sarah, John? How was the lilo? "
SHERLOCK," Oh yes, of course. "
MYCROFT, Sherlock’s business seems to be booming since you and he became ... pals. 
JOHN, I’m never bored. 
MYCROFT," Andrew West, known as Westie to his friends. "
MYCROFT," A civil servant, found dead on the tracks at Battersea Station this morning with his head smashed in. "
JOHN, Jumped in front of a train? 
MYCROFT, Seems the logical assumption. 
MYCROFT, “But”? 
JOHN," Well, you wouldn’t be here if it was just an accident. "
MYCROFT," The M.O.D. is working on a new missile defence system – the Bruce-Partington Programme, it’s called. "
MYCROFT, The plans for it were on a memory stick. 
JOHN, That wasn’t very clever. 
JOHN, Oh. 
MYCROFT, But it is secret. And missing. 
JOHN, Top secret? 
MYCROFT, Very. We think West must have taken the memory stick. We can’t possibly risk it falling into the wrong hands. 
MYCROFT," You’ve got to find those plans, Sherlock. Don’t make me order you. "
SHERLOCK, I’d like to see you try. 
MYCROFT," Goodbye, John. "
MYCROFT, See you very soon. 
JOHN, Why’d you lie? 
JOHN, You’ve got nothing on – not a single case. That’s why the wall took a pounding. Why did you tell your brother you were busy? 
JOHN," Oh! (He nods.) Oh, I see. "
JOHN, Sibling rivalry. Now we’re getting somewhere. 
SHERLOCK, Of course. How could I refuse? 
SHERLOCK, Lestrade. I’ve been summoned. Coming? 
JOHN, If you want me to. 
SHERLOCK, Of course. 
SHERLOCK, I’d be lost without my blogger. 
LESTRADE," You like the funny cases, don’t you? The surprising ones. "
SHERLOCK, Obviously. 
LESTRADE, You’ll love this. That explosion ... 
LESTRADE, No. 
SHERLOCK, No? 
LESTRADE, No. Made to look like one. 
JOHN, What? 
LESTRADE, Hardly anything left of the place except a strong box – a very strong box – and inside it was this. 
SHERLOCK, You haven’t opened it? 
LESTRADE," It’s addressed to you, isn’t it? "
LESTRADE, We’ve X-rayed it. It’s not booby-trapped. 
SHERLOCK, Nice stationery. Bohemian. 
LESTRADE, What? 
SHERLOCK, From the Czech Republic. No fingerprints? 
LESTRADE, No. 
JOHN, “She”? 
SHERLOCK, Obviously. 
LESTRADE," What, from the Study in Pink? "
SHERLOCK," Well, obviously it’s not the same phone but it’s supposed to look like ... "
SHERLOCK, The Study in Pink? You read his blog? 
LESTRADE, Course I read his blog! We all do. D’you really not know that the Earth goes round the Sun? 
SHERLOCK, It isn’t the same phone. This one’s brand new. 
SHERLOCK," Someone’s gone to a lot of trouble to make it look like the same phone, which means your blog has a far wider readership. "
VOICE ALERT, You have one new message. 
JOHN, Is that it? 
SHERLOCK, No. That’s not it. 
LESTRADE, What the hell are we supposed to make of that? An estate agent’s photo and the bloody Greenwich pips! 
JOHN, A warning? 
SHERLOCK," Some secret societies used to send dried melon seeds, orange pips, things like that. Five pips. They’re warning us it’s gonna happen again. "
SHERLOCK, And I’ve seen this place before. 
SHERLOCK, Mrs Hudson! 
MRS HUDSON," You had a look, didn’t you, Sherlock, when you first came to see about your flat. "
MRS HUDSON," No, can’t be. That’s the only key. "
MRS HUDSON," I can’t get anyone interested in this flat. It’s the damp, I expect. That’s the curse of basements. "
MRS HUDSON, I had a place once when I was first married. Black mould all up the walls ... 
 The room looks exactly as it did in the photograph on the phone with one exception," there is a pair of trainers placed neatly side by side in the middle of the floor, their toes pointed towards the door. John stops and looks at them before stating the bleedin’ obvious. "
JOHN, Shoes. 
JOHN," He’s a bomber, remember. "
s VOICE, H-hello ... sexy. 
SHERLOCK, Who’s this? 
SHERLOCK, Who’s talking? Why are you crying? 
WOMAN, ... and this ... stupid ... bitch ... is reading it out. 
JOHN, What? 
SHERLOCK, Nothing. 
JOHN," No, what did you mean? "
WOMAN," Twelve hours to solve ... my puzzle, Sherlock ... "
WOMAN, ... or I’m going ... to be ... so naughty. 
JOHN," So, who d’you suppose it was? "
JOHN, The woman on the phone – the crying woman. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, she doesn’t matter. She’s just a hostage. No lead there. "
SHERLOCK, You’re not going to be much use to her. 
JOHN," Are-are they trying to trace it, trace the call? "
SHERLOCK, The bomber’s too smart for that. 
SHERLOCK, Pass me my phone. 
JOHN, Where is it? 
SHERLOCK, Jacket. 
JOHN, Text from your brother. 
SHERLOCK, Delete it. 
JOHN, Delete it? 
SHERLOCK, Missile plans are out of the country now. Nothing we can do about it. 
 which reads, 
RE, BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS 
JOHN," Well, Mycroft thinks there is. He’s texted you eight times. Must be important. "
SHERLOCK, Then why didn’t he cancel his dental appointment? 
SHERLOCK," Mycroft never texts if he can talk. Look, Andrew West stole the missile plans, tried to sell them, got his head smashed in for his pains. End of story. The only mystery is this: why is my brother so determined to bore me when somebody else is being so delightfully interesting? "
SHERLOCK, What for? 
SHERLOCK," This hospital’s full of people dying, Doctor. Why don’t you go and cry by their bedside and see what good it does them? "
MOLLY, Any luck? 
JIM," Oh, sorry. I didn’t ... "
MOLLY, Jim! Hi! 
MOLLY, Come in! Come in! 
MOLLY," Jim, this is Sherlock Holmes. "
JIM, Ah! 
JOHN, John Watson. Hi. 
JIM, Hi. 
JIM, So you’re Sherlock Holmes. Molly’s told me all about you. You on one of your cases? 
MOLLY, Jim works in I.T. upstairs. That’s how we met. Office romance. 
SHERLOCK, Gay. 
MOLLY," Sorry, what? "
SHERLOCK," Nothing. (He smiles round falsely at Jim.) Um, hey. "
JIM," Well, I’d better be off. I’ll see you at The Fox, ’bout six-ish? "
MOLLY, Yeah! 
JIM, ’Bye. 
JOHN, You too. 
MOLLY," What d’you mean, gay? We’re together. "
MOLLY, Two and a half. 
SHERLOCK," Nuh, three. "
JOHN, Sherlock ... 
JOHN, Because he puts a bit of product in his hair? I put product in my hair. 
SHERLOCK, You wash your hair. There’s a difference. No-no – tinted eyelashes; clear signs of taurine cream around the frown lines; those tired clubber’s eyes. Then there’s his underwear. 
MOLLY, His underwear? 
SHERLOCK, Visible above the waistline – very visible; very particular brand. 
SHERLOCK," That, plus the extremely suggestive fact that he just left his number under this dish here ... (he shows her the card that Jim left under the dish) ... and I’d say you’d better break it off now and save yourself the pain. "
JOHN, Charming. Well done. 
SHERLOCK, Just saving her time. Isn’t that kinder? 
JOHN," “Kinder”? No, no, Sherlock. That wasn’t kind. "
SHERLOCK," Go on, then. "
JOHN, Mmm? 
SHERLOCK, You know what I do. Off you go. 
JOHN, No. 
SHERLOCK, Go on. 
JOHN, I’m not gonna stand here so you can humiliate me while I try and disseminate ... 
JOHN," Yeah, right(!) "
SHERLOCK, Really. 
JOHN, Fine. 
JOHN, I dunno – they’re just a pair of shoes. (He immediately corrects himself.) Trainers. 
SHERLOCK, Good. 
JOHN," Umm ... they’re in good nick. I’d say they were pretty new ... except the sole has been well-worn, so the owner must have had them for a while. "
JOHN," Uh, they’re very eighties – probably one of those retro designs. "
SHERLOCK, You’re on sparkling form. What else? 
JOHN," Well, they’re quite big, so a man’s. "
SHERLOCK, But ...? 
JOHN," Uh ... (he looks again at the shoe he’s holding, then puts it down) ... that’s it. "
SHERLOCK, That’s it? 
JOHN, How did I do? 
SHERLOCK," Well, John; really well. "
SHERLOCK," I mean, you missed almost everything of importance, but, um, you know ... "
SHERLOCK," The owner loved these. Scrubbed them clean, whitened them where they got discoloured. Changed the laces three ... no, four times. "
SHERLOCK," Even so, there are traces of his flaky skin where his fingers have come into contact with them, so he suffered from eczema. Shoes are well-worn, more so on the inside, which means the owner had weak arches. British-made, twenty years old. "
SHERLOCK, They’re not retro – they’re original. 
SHERLOCK," Limited edition: two blue stripes, nineteen eighty-nine. "
JOHN, But there’s still mud on them. They look new. 
JOHN, How do you know? 
SHERLOCK," South of the river, too. So, the kid who owned these trainers came to London from Sussex twenty years ago and left them behind. "
JOHN, So what happened to him? 
SHERLOCK, Something bad. 
SHERLOCK," He loved those shoes, remember. He’d never leave them filthy. Wouldn’t leave them go unless he had to. So: a child with big feet gets ... "
JOHN, What? 
JOHN," Sorry, who? "
JOHN, What is it? 
SHERLOCK, It’s where I began.
SHERLOCK," Nineteen eighty-nine, a young kid – champion swimmer – came up from Brighton for a school sports tournament; drowned in the pool. Tragic accident. "
SHERLOCK, You wouldn’t remember it. Why should you? 
JOHN, But you remember. 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
JOHN, Something fishy about it? 
SHERLOCK, Nobody thought so – nobody except me. I was only a kid myself. I read about it in the papers. 
JOHN," Started young, didn’t you? "
SHERLOCK," The boy, Carl Powers, had some kind of fit in the water, but by the time they got him out it was too late. But there was something wrong; something I couldn’t get out of my head. "
JOHN, What? 
SHERLOCK, His shoes. 
JOHN, What about them? 
SHERLOCK," They weren’t there. I made a fuss; I tried to get the police interested, but nobody seemed to think it was important. He’d left all the rest of his clothes in his locker, but there was no sign of his shoes ... "
SHERLOCK, ... until now. 
JOHN, Can I help? 
JOHN, I want to help. There’s only five hours left. 
 It reads, 
JOHN, It’s your brother. He’s texting me now. 
JOHN, How does he know my number? 
JOHN," Look, he did say ‘national importance.’ "
SHERLOCK, How quaint. 
JOHN, What is? 
SHERLOCK, You are. Queen and country. 
SHERLOCK, I’m not ignoring it. Putting my best man onto it right now. 
JOHN, Right. Good. 
JOHN, Who’s that? 
MYCROFT, John. How nice. I was hoping you wouldn’t be long. 
MYCROFT, How can I help you? 
JOHN," Thank you. (He sits.) Um, well, I was wanting to ... um, your brother sent me to collect more facts about the stolen plans, the missile plans. "
MYCROFT, Did he? 
JOHN, Yes. 
JOHN, He’s investigating now. 
JOHN," He’s, er, investigating away. "
JOHN," Um, I just wondered what else you can tell me about the dead man. "
MYCROFT," Uh, twenty-seven; a clerk at Vauxhall Cross – er, MI6. He was involved in the Bruce-Partington Programme in a minor capacity. Security checks A-OK; no known terrorist affiliations or sympathies ... "
MYCROFT, Last seen by his fiancée at ten thirty yesterday evening. 
WESTIE," Lucy, love, I’ve gotta go out. I’ve gotta see someone. "
LUCY, Westie! 
JOHN," Right. He was found at Battersea, yes? So he got on the train. "
MYCROFT, No. 
JOHN, What? 
MYCROFT, He had an Oyster card ... 
MYCROFT, ... but it hadn’t been used. 
JOHN, Must have bought a ticket. 
JOHN, Then ... 
MYCROFT, Then how did he end up with a bashed-in brain on the tracks at Battersea? That is the question – the one I was rather hoping Sherlock would provide an answer to. How’s he getting on? 
JOHN," He-he’s fine, yes. Oh, and-and it is going ... very well. It’s, um, you know – he’s completely focussed on it. "
SHERLOCK, Poison. 
MRS HUDSON, What you going on about? 
SHERLOCK, Clostridium botulinum! 
SHERLOCK, It’s one of the deadliest poisons on the planet! 
SHERLOCK, Carl Powers! 
JOHN," Oh, wait, are you saying he was murdered? "
SHERLOCK, Remember the shoelaces? 
JOHN, Mmm. 
SHERLOCK," The boy suffered from eczema. It’d be the easiest thing in the world to introduce the poison into his medication. Two hours later he comes up to London, the poison takes effect, paralyses the muscles and he drowns. "
JOHN, What – how-how come the autopsy didn’t pick that up? 
SHERLOCK, It’s virtually undetectable. Nobody would have been looking for it. 
 and he now begins to type into the message box, 
He bends down and continues to type, 
SHERLOCK, That’s why they had to go. 
JOHN, So how do we let the bomber know ... 
SHERLOCK, Get his attention ... 
JOHN, Mm-hm. 
JOHN, The killer kept the shoes all these years. 
SHERLOCK, Yes. (He looks at John.) Meaning ... 
JOHN, He’s our bomber. 
WOMAN," Well done, you. Come and get me. "
LESTRADE," She lives in Cornwall. Two men broke in wearing masks, forced her to drive to the car park and decked her out in enough explosives to take down a house. "
LESTRADE, Told her to phone you. She had to read out from this pager. 
SHERLOCK," And if she deviated by one word, the sniper would set her off. "
JOHN, Or if you hadn’t solved the case. 
JOHN, “Elegant”? 
LESTRADE, But what was the point? Why would anyone do this? 
SHERLOCK, Oh – I can’t be the only person in the world that gets bored. 
VOICE ALERT, You have one new message. 
JOHN, Four pips. 
SHERLOCK," First test passed, it would seem. Here’s the second. "
SHERLOCK," It’s abandoned, wouldn’t you say? "
LESTRADE, I’ll see if it’s been reported. 
DONOVAN," Freak, it’s for you. "
SHERLOCK, Hello? 
YOUNG MAN, It’s okay that you’ve gone to the police. 
SHERLOCK, Who is this? Is this you again? 
YOUNG MAN, But don’t rely on them. 
YOUNG MAN," Clever you, guessing about Carl Powers. "
YOUNG MAN, I never liked him. 
YOUNG MAN," Carl laughed at me, so I stopped him laughing. "
YOUNG MAN, This is about you and me. 
SHERLOCK, Who are you? 
SHERLOCK, What’s that noise? 
YOUNG MAN," The sounds of life, Sherlock. "
YOUNG MAN, ... I can soon fix that. 
YOUNG MAN, You solved my last puzzle in nine hours. This time you have eight. 
LESTRADE, Okay ... Great. 
LESTRADE, We’ve found it. 
LESTRADE," Told his wife he was going away on a business trip, but he never arrived. "
DONOVAN, You’re still hanging round him. 
JOHN," Yeah, well ... "
DONOVAN," Opposites attract, I suppose. "
JOHN," No, we’re not ... "
DONOVAN," You should get yourself a hobby – stamps, maybe. Model trains. Safer. "
LESTRADE," Before you ask, yes, it’s Monkford’s blood. The DNA checks out. "
SHERLOCK, No body. 
DONOVAN, Not yet. 
SHERLOCK, Mrs Monkford? 
MRS MONKFORD, Yes. 
MRS MONKFORD," Sorry, but I’ve already spoken with two policemen. "
JOHN," No, we’re not from the police; we’re ... "
SHERLOCK," Sherlock Holmes. Very old friend of your husband’s. We, um ... "
SHERLOCK, ... we grew up together. 
MRS MONKFORD," I’m sorry, who? I don’t think he ever mentioned you. "
SHERLOCK," I mean, I just can’t believe it. I only saw him the other day. Same old Ian – not a care in the world. "
MRS MONKFORD," Sorry, but my husband has been depressed for months. Who are you? "
SHERLOCK," Really strange that he hired a car. Why would he do that? It’s a bit suspicious, isn’t it? "
MRS MONKFORD," No, it isn’t. He forgot to renew the tax on the car, that’s all. "
SHERLOCK," Oh, well, that was Ian! That was Ian all over! "
MRS MONKFORD, No it wasn’t. 
SHERLOCK, Wasn’t it? Interesting. 
MRS MONKFORD, Who was I talking to? 
JOHN," Sorry, what? "
SHERLOCK, I referred to her husband in the past tense. She joined in. Bit premature – they’ve only just found the car. 
JOHN, You think she murdered her husband? 
SHERLOCK, Definitely not. That’s not a mistake a murderer would make. 
JOHN," I see. No, I don’t. What am I seeing? "
DONOVAN, Fishing! Try fishing! 
JOHN, Where now? 
SHERLOCK, Janus Cars. 
SHERLOCK, Just found this in the glove compartment. 
EWERT, Can’t see how I can help you gentlemen. 
JOHN, Mr Monkford hired the car from you yesterday. 
EWERT, Yeah. Lovely motor. Mazda RX-8. Wouldn’t mind one of them myself! 
SHERLOCK, Is that one? 
EWERT," No, they’re all Jags. Yeah, I can see you’re not a car man, eh? "
SHERLOCK," But, er, surely you can afford one – a Mazda, I mean? "
EWERT," Yeah, it’s a fair point. But you know how it is: it’s like working in a sweetshop. Once you start picking at the liquorice allsorts, when does it all stop, eh? "
JOHN, But you didn’t know Mr Monkford? 
EWERT," No, he was just a client. Came in here and hired one of my cars. No idea what happened to him. Poor sod. "
SHERLOCK," Nice holiday, Mr Ewert? "
EWERT, Eh? 
SHERLOCK," You’ve been away, haven’t you? "
EWERT," Oh, the-the ... (He gestures towards his tanned face.) No, it’s, er, sunbeds, I’m afraid, yeah. Too busy to get away. My wife would love it, though – bit of sun. "
SHERLOCK, Have you got any change for the cigarette machine? 
EWERT, What? 
SHERLOCK," Well, I noticed one on the way in and I haven’t got any change. "
SHERLOCK, I’m gasping. 
EWERT," Um, well ... (He reaches into his trouser pocket and takes out his wallet.) Hmm. "
EWERT," No, sorry. "
SHERLOCK," Oh well. Thank you very much for your time, Mr Ewert. "
SHERLOCK," You’ve been very helpful. Come on, John. "
JOHN," I-I’ve got change if you still want to, uh ... "
JOHN, So what was that all about? 
SHERLOCK, I needed to look inside his wallet. 
JOHN, Why? 
SHERLOCK, Mr Ewert’s a liar. 
SHERLOCK, Hello? 
SHERLOCK, Why would you be giving me a clue? 
YOUNG MAN," Why does anyone do anything? Because I’m bored. We were made for each other, Sherlock. "
SHERLOCK," How much blood was on that seat, would you say? "
LESTRADE, How much? About a pint. 
SHERLOCK, Not ‘about.’ Exactly a pint. That was their first mistake. The blood’s definitely Ian Monkford’s but it’s been frozen. 
LESTRADE, Frozen? 
SHERLOCK, There are clear signs. I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time ago and that’s what they spread on the seats. 
JOHN, Who did? 
SHERLOCK, Janus Cars. The clue’s in the name. 
JOHN, The god with two faces. 
SHERLOCK, Exactly. 
JOHN, Mmm. 
JOHN, So where is he? 
LESTRADE, Colombia?! 
SHERLOCK, Mr Ewert of Janus Cars had a twenty thousand Colombian peso note in his wallet ... 
SHERLOCK," ... Quite a bit of change, too. He told us he hadn’t been abroad recently, but when I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly. "
SHERLOCK," No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed. That, plus his arm. "
LESTRADE, His arm? 
SHERLOCK," Kept scratching it. Obviously irritating him, and bleeding. "
SHERLOCK," Why? Because he’d recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably. Difficult to tell at that distance. Conclusion: he’d just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia. Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance and she splits it with Janus Cars. "
JOHN, M-Mrs Monkford? 
SHERLOCK, Oh yes. She’s in on it too. 
SHERLOCK," Now go and arrest them, Inspector. That’s what you do best. "
SHERLOCK, We need to let our friendly bomber know that the case is solved. 
SHERLOCK, I am on fire! 
 Sherlock types a new message onto The Science of Deduction, 
SHERLOCK, Feeling better? 
JOHN, Mmm. You realise we’ve hardly stopped for breath since this thing started? 
JOHN, Has it occurred to you ...? 
SHERLOCK, Probably. 
JOHN, No – has it occurred to you that the bomber’s playing a game with you? The envelope; breaking into the other flat; the dead kid’s shoes – it’s all meant for you. 
JOHN," Is it him, then? Moriarty? "
SHERLOCK, Perhaps. 
SHERLOCK, That could be anybody. 
JOHN," Well, it could be, yeah. Lucky for you, I’ve been more than a little unemployed. "
SHERLOCK, How d’you mean? 
JOHN," Lucky for you, Mrs Hudson and I watch far too much telly. "
CONNIE," Thank you, Tyra! Doesn’t she look lovely, everybody, now? "
CONNIE," Anyway, speaking of silk purses and sows’ ears ... "
SHERLOCK, Hello? 
OLD WOMAN, This one ... is a bit ... defective. Sorry. 
OLD WOMAN, She’s blind. This is ... a funny one. 
OLD WOMAN, I’ll give you ... twelve hours. 
OLD WOMAN, I like ... to watch you ... dance. 
 a voiceover replaces her voice and a news headline at the bottom of the screen reads, Make-over Queen Connie Prince dead at 48.) 
NEWS READER," ... continuing into the sudden death of the popular TV personality, Connie Prince. Miss Prince, famous for her make-over programmes, was found dead two days ago by her brother in the house they shared in Hampstead ... "
LESTRADE," Connie Prince, fifty-four. She had one of those make-over shows on the telly. Did you see it? "
SHERLOCK, No. 
LESTRADE, Very popular. She was going places. 
SHERLOCK," Not any more. So: dead two days. According to one of her staff, Raoul de Santos, she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden. Nasty wound. "
SHERLOCK, Tetanus bacteria enters the bloodstream – good night Vienna. 
JOHN, I suppose. 
SHERLOCK, Something’s wrong with this picture. 
LESTRADE, Eh? 
SHERLOCK," Can’t be as simple as it seems, otherwise the bomber wouldn’t be directing us towards it. Something’s wrong. "
SHERLOCK, John? 
JOHN, Mmm. 
SHERLOCK," The cut on her hand: it’s deep; would have bled a lot, right? "
JOHN, Yeah. 
SHERLOCK," But the wound’s clean – very clean, and fresh. "
SHERLOCK, How long would the bacteria have been incubating inside her? 
JOHN," Eight, ten days. "
JOHN, The cut was made later. 
LESTRADE, After she was dead? 
SHERLOCK," Must have been. The only question is, how did the tetanus enter the dead woman’s system? "
SHERLOCK," You want to help, right? "
JOHN, Of course. 
SHERLOCK," Connie Prince’s background – family history, everything. Give me data. "
JOHN, Right. 
LESTRADE, There’s something else that we haven’t thought of. 
LESTRADE," Yes. Why is he doing this, the bomber? "
LESTRADE," If this woman’s death was suspicious, why point it out? "
LESTRADE, ... who press-gangs suicide bombers? 
SHERLOCK, Bad Samaritan. 
LESTRADE," I’m – I’m serious, Sherlock. Listen: I’m cutting you slack here; I’m trusting you – but out there somewhere, some poor bastard’s covered in Semtex and is just waiting for you to solve the puzzle. So just tell me: what are we dealing with? "
SHERLOCK, Something new. 
 The wall behind the sofa is covered with paperwork," maps, photographs of Connie Prince – both when she was alive and pictures taken in the morgue – photos of Carl Powers, press cuttings and various sheets of paper with notes scribbled on them. Pieces of string are pinned between some of the exhibits, linking them together. Sherlock is pacing back and forth in front of the sofa while Lestrade stands nearby. "
SHERLOCK," Carl Powers, killed twenty years ago. The bomber knew him; admitted that he knew him. The bomber’s iPhone was in stationery from the Czech Republic. First hostage from Cornwall; the second from London; the third from Yorkshire, judging by her accent. What’s he doing – working his way round the world? Showing off? "
OLD WOMAN," You’re enjoying this, aren’t you? Joining the ... dots. "
OLD WOMAN, Three hours: boom ... boom. 
KENNY, We’re devastated. Of course we are. 
RAOUL," Can I get you anything, sir? "
JOHN," Er, no. No, thanks. "
KENNY, Raoul is my rock. I don’t think I could have managed. 
KENNY," We didn’t always see eye to eye, but my sister was very dear to me. "
JOHN," And – and to the public, Mr Prince. "
KENNY," Oh, she was adored. I’ve seen her take girls who looked like the back end of Routemasters and turn them into princesses. "
KENNY," Still, it’s a relief in a way to know that she’s beyond this vale of tears. "
SHERLOCK, Great. ... Thank you. Thanks again. 
MRS HUDSON, It was a real shame. I liked her. She taught you how to do your colours. 
LESTRADE, Colours? 
MRS HUDSON," You know ... (she gestures down at her clothes) ... what goes best with what. I should never wear cerise, apparently. Drains me. "
LESTRADE, Who was that? 
SHERLOCK," Well, Home Secretary, actually. Owes me a favour. "
MRS HUDSON," People can hardly move their faces. It’s silly, isn’t it?! "
MRS HUDSON, Did you ever see her show? 
SHERLOCK, Not until now. 
CONNIE," You look pasty, love! "
KENNY, Ah. (He looks at the audience.) Rained every day but one! 
MRS HUDSON," That’s the brother. No love lost there, if you can believe the papers. "
SHERLOCK, So I gather. I’ve just been having a very fruitful chat with people who loved this show. Fan sites – indispensible for gossip. 
CONNIE, Off! Off! Off! Off! 
JOHN," It’s more common than people think. The tetanus is in the soil, people cut themselves on rose bushes, garden forks, that sort of thing. If left un... "
JOHN, ...treated ... 
KENNY, I don’t know what I’m going to do now. 
KENNY," I mean, she’s left me this place, which is lovely ... "
KENNY, ... but it’s not the same without her. 
KENNY, No. 
JOHN, Right. 
SHERLOCK, John. 
SHERLOCK, I’ll remember.
JOHN, That’ll be him. 
KENNY, What? 
SHERLOCK," Ah, Mr Prince, isn’t it? "
KENNY, Yes. 
SHERLOCK, Very good to meet you. 
KENNY, Yes; thank you. 
SHERLOCK, So sorry to hear about ... 
KENNY," Yes, yes, very kind. "
JOHN," Shall we, er ... "
JOHN, Yes. 
JOHN," Um, yes. "
JOHN, Can you ...? 
KENNY, Not too close. I’m raw from crying. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, who’s this? "
KENNY, Sekhmet. Named after the Egyptian goddess. 
SHERLOCK, How nice(!) Was she Connie’s? 
KENNY, Yes. 
KENNY, Little present from yours truly. 
JOHN," Sherlock? Uh, light reading? "
SHERLOCK," Oh, um ... "
SHERLOCK, Two point eight. 
KENNY, Bloody hell. What do you think you’re playing at?! 
SHERLOCK, Sorry. 
KENNY," You’re like Laurel and bloody Hardy, you two. What’s going on? "
JOHN," Actually, I think we’ve got what we came for. Excuse us. "
KENNY, What? 
JOHN, Sherlock. 
SHERLOCK, What? 
KENNY, But you’ve not taken anything! 
JOHN," Yes! Ooh, yes! "
JOHN," What? No, yes. Yeah, it is. It must be. It’s how they got the tetanus into her system. Its paws stink of disinfectant. "
JOHN," No, he coated it onto the paws of her cat. It’s a new pet – bound to be a bit jumpy around her. A scratch is almost inevitable. She wouldn’t have ... "
JOHN, He murdered his sister for her money. 
SHERLOCK, Did he? 
SHERLOCK, No. It was revenge. 
JOHN, Revenge? Who wanted revenge? 
SHERLOCK," Raoul, the houseboy. Kenny Prince was the butt of his sister’s jokes, week in, week out, a virtual bullying campaign. Finally he had enough; fell out with her badly. It’s all on the website. She threatened to disinherit Kenny. Raoul had grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle, so ... "
JOHN," What about the disinfectant, then, on the cat’s claws? "
SHERLOCK," Raoul keeps a very clean house. You came through the kitchen door, saw the state of that floor, scrubbed to within an inch of its life. You smell of disinfectant now. No, the cat doesn’t come into it. "
SHERLOCK," Raoul’s internet records do, though. Hope we can get a cab from here. "
SHERLOCK, Raoul de Santos is your killer. Kenny Prince’s houseboy. Second autopsy shows it wasn’t tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince – it was botulinum toxin. 
SHERLOCK, We’ve been here before. Carl Powers? Tut-tut. Our bomber’s repeated himself. 
LESTRADE, So how’d he do it? 
SHERLOCK, Botox injection. 
SHERLOCK," Botox is a diluted form of botulinum. Among other things, Raoul de Santos was employed to give Connie her regular facial injections. My contact at the Home Office gave me the complete records of Raoul’s internet purchases. (He points to the folder.) He’s been bulk ordering Botox for months. "
LESTRADE, You sure about this? 
SHERLOCK, I’m sure. 
LESTRADE, All right – my office. 
JOHN," Hey, Sherlock. How long? "
SHERLOCK, What? 
JOHN, How long have you known? 
SHERLOCK," Well, this one was quite simple, actually, and like I said, the bomber repeated himself. That was a mistake. "
JOHN," No, but Sherl... The hostage... the old woman. She’s been there all this time. "
 Sherlock types into the message box, 
SHERLOCK, Hello? 
OLD WOMAN, He was so ... His voice ... 
OLD WOMAN, He sounded so ... soft. 
JOHN, What’s happened? 
NEWS READER," The explosion, which ripped through several floors, killing twelve people ... "
NEWS READER, ... is said to have been caused by a faulty gas main. A spokesman from the utilities company ... 
JOHN, He certainly gets about. 
SHERLOCK," Well, obviously I lost that round – although technically I did solve the case. "
SHERLOCK, He killed the old lady because she started to describe him. 
SHERLOCK," Just once, he put himself in the firing line. "
JOHN, What d’you mean? 
SHERLOCK," Well, usually, he must stay above it all. He organises these things but no-one ever has direct contact. "
JOHN," What ... like the Connie Prince murder – he-he arranged that? So people come to him wanting their crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday? "
JOHN, Huh. 
 The headline on the screen reads," “Connie Prince: man arrested.” Raoul is shoved into the back of a police car. John looks round at Sherlock, who is looking down at the pink phone.) "
SHERLOCK, Taking his time this time. 
JOHN, Anything on the Carl Powers case? 
SHERLOCK, Nothing. All the living classmates check out spotless. No connection. 
JOHN, Maybe the killer was older than Carl? 
SHERLOCK, The thought had occurred. 
JOHN," So why’s he doing this, then – playing this game with you? D’you think he wants to be caught? "
SHERLOCK, I think he wants to be distracted. 
JOHN, I hope you’ll be very happy together. 
SHERLOCK," Sorry, what? "
JOHN," There are lives at stake, Sherlock – actual human lives... Just – just so I know, do you care about that at all? "
JOHN, Nope. 
SHERLOCK, Then I’ll continue not to make that mistake. 
JOHN," And you find that easy, do you? "
SHERLOCK," Yes, very. Is that news to you? "
JOHN, No. (He smiles bitterly.) No. 
SHERLOCK, I’ve disappointed you. 
SHERLOCK," Don’t make people into heroes, John. Heroes don’t exist, and if they did, I wouldn’t be one of them. "
SHERLOCK, Excellent! 
SHERLOCK, View of the Thames. South Bank – somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo. 
SHERLOCK, You check the papers; I’ll look online ... 
SHERLOCK," Oh, you’re angry with me, so you won’t help. "
SHERLOCK," Not much cop, this caring lark. "
 Sherlock dismisses John from his mind and begins a search on his phone, 
Search, 
JOHN, Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington. 
JOHN, Ah. Man found on the train line – Andrew West. 
SHERLOCK, Nothing! 
SHERLOCK, It’s me. Have you found anything on the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge? 
LESTRADE," D’you reckon this is connected, then? The bomber? "
SHERLOCK," Must be. Odd, though ... (he holds up the pink phone) ... he hasn’t been in touch. "
LESTRADE," But we must assume that some poor bugger’s primed to explode, yeah? "
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
LESTRADE, Any ideas? 
SHERLOCK, Seven ... so far. 
LESTRADE, Seven?! 
JOHN, He’s dead about twenty-four hours – maybe a bit longer. (He looks up at Lestrade.) Did he drown? 
LESTRADE, Apparently not. Not enough of the Thames in his lungs. Asphyxiated. 
JOHN," Yes, I’d agree. "
 then selects the latter option and the screen changes to, 
JOHN, There’s quite a bit of bruising around the nose and mouth. More bruises here and here. 
 Sherlock shifts to a new search, 
He scrolls through the options, 
JOHN," In his late thirties, I’d say. Not in the best condition. "
SHERLOCK, He’s been in the river a long while. The water’s destroyed most of the data. 
SHERLOCK, But I’ll tell you one thing: that lost Vermeer painting’s a fake. 
LESTRADE, What? 
SHERLOCK, We need to identify the corpse. Find out about his friends and associates ... 
LESTRADE, Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. What painting? What are you – what are you on about? 
SHERLOCK," It’s all over the place. Haven’t you seen the posters? Dutch Old Master, supposed to have been destroyed centuries ago; now it’s turned up. Worth thirty million pounds. "
LESTRADE, Okay. So what has that got to do with the stiff? 
LESTRADE, Golem? 
JOHN," It’s a horror story, isn’t it? What are you saying? "
SHERLOCK, Jewish folk story. A gigantic man made of clay. It’s also the name of an assassin – real name Oskar Dzundza – one of the deadliest assassins in the world. 
SHERLOCK, That is his trademark style. 
LESTRADE, So this is a hit? 
SHERLOCK, Definitely. The Golem squeezes the life out of his victims with his bare hands. 
LESTRADE, But what has this gotta do with that painting? I don’t see ... 
JOHN," All right, all right, girls, calm down. Sherlock? D’you wanna take us through it? "
SHERLOCK," What do we know about this corpse? The killer’s not left us with much – just the shirt and the trousers. They’re pretty formal – maybe he was going out for the night, but the trousers are heavy-duty, polyester, nasty, same as the shirt – cheap. They’re both too big for him, so some kind of standard-issue uniform. Dressed for work, then. What kind of work? There’s a hook on his belt for a walkie-talkie. "
LESTRADE, Tube driver? 
JOHN, Security guard? 
SHERLOCK, More likely. That’ll be borne out by his backside. 
LESTRADE, Backside?! 
SHERLOCK," Flabby. You’d think that he’d led a sedentary life, yet the soles of his feet and the nascent varicose veins in his legs show otherwise. So, a lot of walking and a lot of sitting around. Security guard’s looking good. And the watch helps, too. The alarm shows he did regular night shifts. "
LESTRADE, Why regular? Maybe he just set his alarm like that the night before he died. 
SHERLOCK," No-no-no, the buttons are stiff, hardly touched. He set his alarm like that a long time ago. His routine never varied. But there’s something else. The killer must have been interrupted, otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely. There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off, suggesting the dead man worked somewhere recognisable, some kind of institution. "
SHERLOCK, Found this inside his trouser pockets. 
SHERLOCK, Sodden by the river but still recognisably ... 
SHERLOCK, Ticket stubs. He worked in a museum or gallery. Did a quick check – the Hickman Gallery has reported one of its attendants as missing. 
SHERLOCK, Alex Woodbridge. Tonight they unveil the re-discovered masterpiece. Now why would anyone want to pay the Golem to suffocate a perfectly ordinary gallery attendant? Inference: the dead man knew something about it – something that would stop the owner getting paid thirty million pounds. The picture’s a fake. 
LESTRADE, And a Happy New Year! 
JOHN, Poor sod. 
LESTRADE, I’d better get my feelers out for this Golem character. 
SHERLOCK, Pointless. You’ll never find him. But I know a man who can. 
LESTRADE, Who? 
SHERLOCK, Why hasn’t he phoned? He’s broken his pattern. Why? 
SHERLOCK, Waterloo Bridge. 
JOHN, Where now? The Gallery? 
SHERLOCK, In a bit. 
JOHN," The Hickman’s contemporary art, isn’t it? Why have they got hold of an Old Master? "
SHERLOCK, Dunno. Dangerous to jump to conclusions. Need data. 
SHERLOCK, Stop! 
SHERLOCK, You wait here. I won’t be a moment. 
HOMELESS GIRL, Change? Any change? 
SHERLOCK, What for? 
HOMELESS GIRL," Cup of tea, of course. "
JOHN, What are you doing? 
SHERLOCK, Investing. 
SHERLOCK, Now we go to the Gallery. 
SHERLOCK, Have you got any cash? 
SHERLOCK, No. I need you to find out all you can about the gallery attendant. Lestrade will give you the address. 
JOHN, Okay. 
JULIE, We’d been sharing about a year. Just sharing. 
JOHN, Mmm. 
JOHN, May I? 
JULIE, Yeah. 
JOHN, Sorry. 
JOHN," Stargazer, was he? "
JULIE," God, yeah. Mad about it. It’s all he ever did in his spare time. "
JULIE," He was a nice guy, Alex. I liked him. "
JULIE," He was, er, never much of a one for hoovering. "
JOHN, What about art? Did he know anything about that? 
JOHN, Hmm. 
JOHN, Has anyone else been round asking about Alex? 
JULIE," No. We had a break-in, though. "
JULIE, Last night. There was nothing taken. Oh – there was a message left for Alex on the landline. 
JOHN, Who was it from? 
JULIE," Well, I can play it for you if you like. I’ll get the phone. "
JOHN, Please. 
s VOICE," Oh, should I speak now? Alex? Love, it’s Professor Cairns. Listen, you were right. You were bloody right! Give us a call when ... "
JOHN, Professor Cairns? 
JULIE," No, no idea, sorry. "
JOHN, Mm. Can I try and ring back? 
JULIE," Well, no good. I mean, I’ve had other calls since – sympathy ones, you know. "
 He gets out the phone and looks at the message which reads, 
RE, BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS 
MISS WENCESLAS, Yes. Lovely. Now get back to work. We open tonight. 
SHERLOCK, Doesn’t it bother you? 
MISS WENCESLAS, What? 
SHERLOCK, That the painting’s a fake. 
SHERLOCK, It’s a fake. It has to be. It’s the only possible explanation. 
SHERLOCK," You’re in charge, aren’t you, Miss Wenceslas? "
MISS WENCESLAS, Who are you? 
MISS WENCESLAS, Golem? What the hell are you talking about? 
SHERLOCK, Or are you working for someone else? Did you fake it for them? 
MISS WENCESLAS, It’s not a fake. 
SHERLOCK," It is a fake. Don’t know why, but there’s something wrong with it. There has to be. "
MISS WENCESLAS," What the hell are you on about? You know, I could have you sacked on the spot. "
SHERLOCK, Not a problem. 
MISS WENCESLAS, No? 
SHERLOCK," No. I don’t work here, you see. Just popped in to give you a bit of friendly advice. "
MISS WENCESLAS, How did you get in? 
MISS WENCESLAS, I want to know. 
SHERLOCK, The art of disguise is knowing how to hide in plain sight. 
MISS WENCESLAS, Who are you? 
SHERLOCK, Sherlock Holmes. 
MISS WENCESLAS, Am I supposed to be impressed? 
SHERLOCK, You should be. 
SHERLOCK, Have a nice day! 
LUCY, He wouldn’t. He just wouldn’t. 
LUCY, Westie wasn’t a traitor. It’s a horrible thing to say! 
JOHN," I’m sorry, but you must understand that’s ... "
LUCY," That’s what they think, isn’t it, his bosses? "
LUCY, Everyone’s got debts; and Westie wouldn’t wanna clear them by selling out his country. 
JOHN," Can you, um, can you tell me exactly what happened that night? "
LUCY," We were having a night in, just watching a DVD. "
LUCY," He normally falls asleep, you know, but he sat through this one. He was quiet. "
LUCY," Out of the blue, he said he just had to go and see someone. "
JOHN, And you’ve no idea who? 
JOE," Oh, hi, Luce. You okay, love? "
LUCY, Yeah. 
JOE, Who’s this? 
JOHN, John Watson. Hi. 
JOHN," Uh, sort of, yeah. "
JOE," Well, tell ’em to get off their arses, will you? It’s bloody ridiculous. "
JOHN, I’ll do my best. 
JOHN," Well, er, thanks very much for your help; and again, I’m very, very sorry. "
LUCY," He didn’t steal those things, Mr Watson. "
LUCY, I knew Westie. He was a good man. (She starts to cry.) He was my good man. 
 Edit," John walks away, looking like one awesome BAMF and melting ovaries everywhere. There, fixed it for you me.) "
HOMELESS GIRL, Spare change? Any spare change? 
JOHN, Alex Woodbridge didn’t know anything special about art. 
SHERLOCK, And? 
JOHN, And ... 
SHERLOCK," Is that it? No habits, hobbies, personality? "
JOHN," No, give us a chance! He was an amateur astronomer. "
SHERLOCK, Hold that cab. 
HOMELESS GIRL," Spare change, sir? "
SHERLOCK, Don’t mind if I do. 
SHERLOCK," Fortunately, I haven’t been idle. "
SHERLOCK, Come on. 
SHERLOCK," Beautiful, isn’t it? "
JOHN, I thought you didn’t care about things like that. 
SHERLOCK, Doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate it. 
JOHN, Listen: Alex Woodbridge had a message on the answerphone at his flat – a Professor Cairns? 
SHERLOCK, This way. 
JOHN," Nice(!) Nice part of town. Er, any time you wanna explain. "
SHERLOCK, Homeless network – really is indispensible. 
SHERLOCK, My eyes and ears all over the city. 
JOHN," Oh, that’s clever. So you scratch their backs and ... "
SHERLOCK," Yes, then I disinfect myself. "
JOHN, Sherlock! 
SHERLOCK, Come on! 
JOHN, Oh shi... 
JOHN, I wish I’d ... 
SHERLOCK," No, no, no, no! It’ll take us weeks to find him again. "
JOHN, Or not. I have an idea where he might be going. 
SHERLOCK, What? 
JOHN, I told you: someone left Alex Woodbridge a message. There can’t be that many Professor Cairns in the book. Come on. 
NARRATOR, Titan is the largest moon. 
NARRATOR, Many are actually long dead ... 
CAIRNS, Tom? Is that you? 
NARRATOR, ... exploded into supernovas. 
NARRATOR, ... discovered by Urbain Le Verrier in 1846. 
NARRATOR, ... composed mainly of hydrogen. Their light takes so long to reach us ... 
SHERLOCK, Golem! 
SHERLOCK, John! 
JOHN, I can’t see him. I’ll go round. I’ll go! 
JOHN, Golem! 
JOHN," Let him go, or I will kill you. "
NARRATOR," ... long dead, exploded into supernovas. "
SHERLOCK, It’s a fake. It has to be. 
MISS WENCESLAS, That painting has been subjected to every test known to science. 
SHERLOCK," It’s a very good fake, then. "
SHERLOCK," You know about this, don’t you? This is you, isn’t it? "
MISS WENCESLAS," Inspector, my time is being wasted. Would you mind showing yourself and your friends out? "
SHERLOCK, The painting is a fake. 
SHERLOCK, It’s a fake. That’s why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, come on. Proving it’s just the detail. The painting is a fake. I’ve solved it. I’ve figured it out. It’s a fake! That’s the answer. That’s why they were killed. "
SHERLOCK," Okay, I’ll prove it. Give me time. Will you give me time? "
s VOICE, Ten ... 
JOHN, What did he say? 
SHERLOCK, “Ten.” 
s VOICE, Nine ... 
LESTRADE, Jesus! 
SHERLOCK," The painting is a fake, but how can I prove it? How? How? "
s VOICE, Eight ... 
s VOICE, Seven ... 
SHERLOCK," No, shut up. Don’t say anything. It only works if I figure it out. "
s VOICE, Six ... 
SHERLOCK," Woodbridge knew, but how? "
s VOICE, Five ... 
LESTRADE, It’s speeding up! 
SHERLOCK, Oh! 
s VOICE, Four ... 
SHERLOCK," In the planetarium! You heard it too. Oh, that is brilliant! That is gorgeous! "
s VOICE, Three ... 
JOHN, What’s brilliant? What is? 
SHERLOCK, This is beautiful. I love this! 
s VOICE, Two ... 
SHERLOCK, The Van Buren Supernova! 
s VOICE, Please. Is somebody there? 
s VOICE, Somebody help me! 
SHERLOCK," The Van Buren Supernova, so-called. (He holds up his phone over his shoulder so that Miss Wenceslas can see the screen.) Exploding star, only appeared in the sky in eighteen fifty-eight. "
JOHN, So how could it have been painted in the sixteen forties? 
JOHN, Oh. 
 and looks at the message which reads, 
JOHN, Oh Sherl... 
SHERLOCK," You know, it’s interesting. Bohemian stationery, an assassin named after a Prague legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas. This whole case has a distinctly Czech feeling about it. Is that where this leads? "
SHERLOCK," What are we looking at, Inspector? "
MISS WENCESLAS, I just wanted my share – the thirty million. 
MISS WENCESLAS," I found a little old man in Argentina. Genius. I mean, really: brushwork immaculate, could fool anyone. "
MISS WENCESLAS," It’s true! I mean, it took a long time, but eventually I was put in touch with people ... his people. "
MISS WENCESLAS," Well, there was never any real contact; just messages ... whispers. "
SHERLOCK, And did those whispers have a name? 
MISS WENCESLAS, Moriarty. 
JOHN, So this is where West was found? 
TUBE GUARD, Yeah. 
JOHN, Uh-huh. 
TUBE GUARD, You gonna be long? 
JOHN, I might be. 
TUBE GUARD," You with the police, then? "
JOHN, Sort of. 
TUBE GUARD, I hate ’em. 
JOHN, The police? 
TUBE GUARD, No. Jumpers. 
TUBE GUARD, People who chuck themselves in front of trains. 
TUBE GUARD, Selfish bastards. 
JOHN," Well, that’s one way of looking at it. "
TUBE GUARD," I mean it. It’s all right for them. It’s over in a split second – strawberry jam all over the lines. What about the drivers, hmm? They’ve gotta live with it, haven’t they? "
JOHN," Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam, there’s no blood on the line. (He stands up again.) Has it been cleaned off? "
TUBE GUARD," No, there wasn’t that much. "
JOHN, You said his head was smashed in. 
TUBE GUARD," Well, it was, but there wasn’t much blood. "
JOHN, Okay. 
TUBE GUARD," Well, I’ll leave you to it then. "
TUBE GUARD, Just give us a shout when you’re off. 
JOHN, Right. 
JOHN," Right: so, uh, Andrew West got on the train somewhere – or did he? There’s no ticket on the body. Then how did he end up here? "
JOHN, Yes! 
SHERLOCK, Knew you’d get there eventually. West wasn’t killed here; that’s why there was so little blood. 
JOHN, How long have you been following me? 
SHERLOCK," Since the start. You don’t think I’d give up on a case like this just to spite my brother, do you? "
SHERLOCK, Come on. Got a bit of burglary to do. 
SHERLOCK," The missile defence plans haven’t left the country, otherwise Mycroft’s people would have heard about it. Despite what people think, we do still have a Secret Service. "
JOHN," Yeah, I know. I’ve met them. "
SHERLOCK, Which means whoever stole the memory stick can’t sell it or doesn’t know what to do with it. My money’s on the latter. We’re here. 
JOHN, Where? 
JOHN, Sherlock! What if there’s someone in? 
SHERLOCK, There isn’t. 
JOHN, Where are we? 
SHERLOCK," Oh, sorry, didn’t I say? Joe Harrison’s flat. "
JOHN, Joe ...? 
SHERLOCK, Brother of West’s fiancée. 
SHERLOCK, He stole the memory stick; killed his prospective brother-in-law. 
JOHN, Then why’d he do it? 
SHERLOCK, Let’s ask him. 
JOHN, Don’t. 
JOE, It wasn’t meant to ... 
JOE, God. (He rubs his hand over his face.) What’s Lucy gonna say? Jesus. 
JOHN, Why did you kill him? 
JOE, It was an accident. 
JOE, I swear it was. 
JOE," I started dealing drugs. I mean, the bike thing’s a great cover, right? I dunno – I dunno how it started; I just got out of my depth. I owed people thousands – serious people. Then at Westie’s engagement do, he starts talking about his job. "
JOE," I mean, usually he’s so careful; but that night after a few pints he really opened up. He told me about these missile plans – beyond top secret. He showed me the memory stick; he waved it in front of me. You hear about these things getting lost, ending up on rubbish tips and what-not. And there it was, and I thought ... well, I thought it could be worth a fortune. "
JOE," It was pretty easy to get the thing off him, he was so plastered. Next time I saw him, I could tell by the look on his face that he knew. "
JOHN, What happened? 
JOE," I was gonna call an ambulance, but it was too late. "
JOE," I just didn’t have a clue what to do, so I dragged him in ’ere, and I just sat in the dark, thinking. "
SHERLOCK, When a neat little idea popped into your head. 
JOHN, And points. 
SHERLOCK, Exactly. 
JOHN," D’you still have it, then? The memory stick? "
SHERLOCK, Fetch it for me – if you wouldn’t mind. 
JOHN," Well, maybe that’s over, too. We’ve heard nothing from the bomber. "
SHERLOCK," Five pips, remember, John? It’s a countdown. We’ve only had four. "
SHERLOCK," No, no, no! Of course he’s not the boy’s father! (He gestures at the screen.) Look at the turn-ups on his jeans! "
JOHN, Knew it was dangerous. 
SHERLOCK, Hmm? 
JOHN, Getting you into crap telly. 
SHERLOCK, Hmm. Not a patch on Connie Prince. 
JOHN, Have you given Mycroft the memory stick yet? 
SHERLOCK, Yep. He was over the moon. Threatened me with a knighthood – again. 
JOHN," You know, I’m still waiting. "
SHERLOCK, Hmm? 
JOHN, For you to admit that a little knowledge of the solar system and you’d have cleared up the fake painting a lot quicker. 
SHERLOCK," Didn’t do you any good, did it? "
JOHN," No, but I’m not the world’s only consulting detective. "
JOHN, I won’t be in for tea. I’m going to Sarah’s. There’s still some of that risotto left in the fridge. 
JOHN," Uh, milk. We need milk. "
SHERLOCK, I’ll get some. 
SHERLOCK, Really. 
JOHN," And some beans, then? "
 JOHN," Evening. (Sherlock’s raised hand begins to lower slowly but otherwise he doesn’t move, still staring over his shoulder in utter disbelief.) JOHN: This is a turn-up, isn’t it, Sherlock? SHERLOCK (softly, shocked): John. What the hell ...? JOHN: Bet you never saw this coming. (Finally Sherlock manages to move, and starts to walk slowly towards the man he had believed to be his friend until now. The shock and bewilderment on his face make him look about twelve years old. Then, with a look of despair which matches Sherlock’s, John takes his hands from his pockets and pulls open his jacket to reveal the bomb strapped to his chest. From somewhere in the upper gallery, the point from a sniper’s laser immediately begins to dance around over the bomb.) JOHN: What ... would you like me ... to make him say ... next? (Sherlock continues to step towards him but now he is looking everywhere but at John as he tries to see who else is in the area.) JOHN (obviously narrating words spoken into an earpiece): Gottle o’ geer ... gottle o’ geer ... gottle o’ geer. (His voice almost breaks on the last phrase.) SHERLOCK: Stop it. JOHN (narrating): Nice touch, this: the pool where little Carl died. I stopped him. (He tries not to cringe as he listens to the next words.) I can stop John Watson too. (He looks down at the laser point on his chest.) Stop his heart. SHERLOCK (turning on the spot while he tries to look in all directions): Who are you? (A door opens at the far end of the pool and a soft male voice with an Irish accent speaks from that direction.) VOICE: I gave you my number. (We get a brief glimpse of a man wearing a suit and tie, but currently he is mostly obscured by a column.) VOICE (plaintively): I thought you might call. (Sherlock turns towards the new arrival, who now slowly walks out into the open. It’s Jim, Molly’s boyfriend. But this isn’t the fumble-fingered casually-dressed Londoner who did indeed leave his number for Sherlock in the lab at Bart’s; this is a sharply-dressed man with immaculate hair and a murderous look on his face. With his hands in his pockets, he casually begins to stroll alongside the deep end of the pool, heading towards Sherlock and John. All hint of plaintiveness has now gone from his voice.) JIM: Is that a British Army Browning L9A1 in your pocket ... (Sherlock reaches down to his trouser pocket and removes a pistol from it.) JIM: ... or are you just pleased to see me? SHERLOCK (raising the pistol and aiming it towards Jim): Both. (Jim stops and looks back at him, unafraid.) JIM: Jim Moriarty. Hi! (Sherlock tilts his head while he looks more closely at the man. Jim acts as if he needs to remind Sherlock who he is.) JIM: Jim? Jim from the hospital? (He begins to walk alongside the deep end again. Sherlock brings up his other hand to support the one aiming the gun. Jim bites his lip as if disappointed.) JIM: Oh. Did I really make such a fleeting impression? But then, I suppose, that was rather the point. (He turns to face Sherlock just as the sniper’s laser flickers over John’s upper chest. Sherlock briefly turns his head towards John, a questioning look on his face.) JIM (starting to walk again): Don’t be silly. Someone else is holding the rifle. I don’t like getting my hands dirty. (He reaches the corner of the pool and stops.) JIM: I’ve given you a glimpse, Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse of what I’ve got going on out there in the big bad world. I’m a specialist, you see ... (He looks surprised, as if he has only just realised the connection.) JIM: ... like you! SHERLOCK: “Dear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover’s nasty sister?” (Starting to walk forward again, Jim grins, clearly recognising the TV show and catchphrase that Sherlock is quoting.) [See footnotes] SHERLOCK: “Dear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America?” JIM (stopping again): Just so. SHERLOCK: Consulting criminal. (softly) Brilliant. JIM (smiling proudly): Isn’t it? No-one ever gets to me – and no-one ever will. SHERLOCK (cocking the pistol): I did. JIM: You’ve come the closest. Now you’re in my way. SHERLOCK: Thank you. JIM: Didn’t mean it as a compliment. SHERLOCK: Yes you did. JIM (shrugging): Yeah, okay, I did. But the flirting’s over, Sherlock ... (His voice becomes high-pitched and sing-song.) Daddy’s had enough now! (He again starts to stroll closer.) JIM (back to his normal tone): I’ve shown you what I can do. I cut loose all those people, all those little problems, even thirty million quid just to get you to come out and play. (John is starting to feel the strain and closes his eyes briefly. Sherlock’s eyes can’t help but flicker across to him a couple of times as he tries to keep his focus on the man approaching them.) JIM: So take this as a friendly warning, my dear. Back off. (He smiles.) JIM: Although I have loved this – this little game of ours. (He puts on his London accent for a moment.) Playing Jim from I.T. (He switches back to his Irish accent.) Playing gay. Did you like the little touch with the underwear? SHERLOCK: People have died. JIM: That’s what people DO! (He screams the last word furiously, his personality changing in an instant.) SHERLOCK (softly): I will stop you. JIM (calmer again): No you won’t. (Sherlock looks across to John.) SHERLOCK: You all right? (John deliberately keeps his gaze away from his friend, presumably having been given instructions earlier about not talking to him. Jim walks forward again and reaches his side.) JIM: You can talk, Johnny-boy. Go ahead. (Refusing to specifically obey Jim’s orders, John meets Sherlock’s eyes and nods once. Sherlock takes one hand off the pistol and holds out the memory stick towards Jim.) SHERLOCK: Take it. JIM: Huh? Oh! That! (He strolls past John and reaches out for the stick, grinning.) JIM: The missile plans! (He takes the stick from Sherlock’s fingers and brings it to his mouth, kissing it. Behind him, John is silently murmuring to himself, perhaps trying to keep himself focussed, perhaps winding himself up to take action, or maybe just expressing his surprise or disappointment that Sherlock lied to him about giving the plans to Mycroft. Jim lowers the memory stick and looks at it.) JIM (sing-song): Boring! (He shakes his head.) JIM: I could have got them anywhere. (He nonchalantly tosses the stick into the pool. Seeing his opportunity, John races forward and slams himself against Jim’s back, wrapping one arm around his neck and the other around his chest. Sherlock backs up a step in surprise but keeps the pistol raised and aimed at Jim.) JOHN: Sherlock, run! (Jim laughs in delight.) JIM: Good! Very good. (Sherlock doesn’t move, still aiming his gun at Jim’s head but now starting to look up a little anxiously, as if wondering what action the hidden sniper might take.) JOHN (savagely): If your sniper pulls that trigger, Mr Moriarty, then we both go up. JIM (calmly, to Sherlock): Isn’t he sweet? I can see why you like having him around. But then people do get so sentimental about their pets. (Grimacing angrily, John pulls him even closer onto the bomb which is now sandwiched between them. Jim scowls round at him.) JIM: They’re so touchingly loyal. But, oops! (He grins briefly at John, then looks towards Sherlock.) JIM: You’ve rather shown your hand there, Doctor Watson. (He chuckles as a new laser point appears in the middle of Sherlock’s forehead. John stares in horror as Jim looks round at him expectantly. Sherlock, either seeing the edge of the laser beam shining from the gallery or realising what’s happening from John’s expression, shakes his head slightly.) JIM (sing-song): Gotcha! (He chuckles as John releases his grip on him and steps back, holding his hands up to signal to the sniper that he won’t be trying anything else. Jim glances round at him, then turns back towards Sherlock while brushing his hands down his suit to straighten it. He gestures to it indignantly.) JIM: Westwood! [See footnotes.] (He lowers his hands and stands calmly in front of Sherlock who is still aiming the pistol at his head.) JIM: D’you know what happens if you don’t leave me alone, Sherlock, to you? SHERLOCK (sounding bored): Oh, let me guess: I get killed. JIM: Kill you? (He grimaces.) N-no, don’t be obvious. I mean, I’m gonna kill you anyway some day. I don’t wanna rush it, though. I’m saving it up for something special. No-no-no-no-no. If you don’t stop prying, I’ll burn you. (He runs his eyes briefly down Sherlock’s body, then meets his eyes again and his voice becomes vicious.) JIM: I’ll burn the heart out of you. (His face is a snarl as he says the word ‘heart’ but at the end of the sentence he looks almost regretful.) SHERLOCK (softly): I have been reliably informed that I don’t have one. JIM: But we both know that’s not quite true. (Sherlock blinks involuntarily. Jim looks down, smiling, then shrugs.) JIM: Well, I’d better be off. (He nonchalantly looks around, perhaps checking his exit route, before turning back to Sherlock.) JIM: Well, so nice to have had a proper chat. (Sherlock raises the pistol higher and extends it closer to Jim’s head.) SHERLOCK: What if I was to shoot you now – right now? JIM (completely unperturbed): Then you could cherish the look of surprise on my face. (He opens his eyes and mouth wide, mimicking shock, then grins at Sherlock.) JIM: ’Cause I’d be surprised, Sherlock; really I would. (He screws up his nose.) JIM: And just a teensy bit disappointed. And of course you wouldn’t be able to cherish it for very long. (Slowly he begins to turn away.) JIM: Ciao, Sherlock Holmes. (Looking back at Sherlock with some distaste, he walks calmly towards the side door through which John came earlier. Sherlock slowly steps forward to keep him in view.) SHERLOCK: Catch ... you ... later. (The door opens and Jim’s voice can be heard, high-pitched and sing-song.) JIM: No you won’t! (The door closes. Sherlock doesn’t move for a few seconds, his gun still aimed towards the door, then his gaze drifts across to John and he instantly bends, putting the pistol on the floor, then drops to his knees in front of John [hush now ...] and starts unfastening the vest to which the bomb is attached.) SHERLOCK: All right? (John tilts his head back, breathing heavily [I said hush now ...].) SHERLOCK (urgently): Are you all right? JOHN: Yeah-yeah, I’m fine. (Having unfastened the vest, Sherlock jumps up and hurries round behind John, starting to pull off the jacket and the bomb vest.) JOHN: I’m fine. (Sherlock, also breathing too fast, continues tugging at the jacket and vest.) JOHN: Sherlock. (Finally Sherlock manages to roughly strip the jacket and vest off John’s arms.) JOHN: Sh-Sherlock! (Sherlock bends and skims the items as far away along the floor as he can, while John staggers at the vehemence with which his friend just ripped them off him.) JOHN (softly): Jesus. (He reaches up and pulls the earpiece from his ear, breathing heavily as delayed shock begins to hit him. Sherlock turns and stares at him for a moment, then hurries back to pick up the pistol before racing towards the door through which Moriarty left. John’s knees buckle and he staggers towards the nearest support, the edge of one of the changing cubicles.) JOHN: Oh, Christ. (He turns and drops down into a squat, bracing his back against the cubicle’s edge while he blows out a long breath and tries to calm himself down. Sherlock comes back in, having apparently seen no sign of Moriarty outside. He starts to pace up and down near John, so hyper and distracted that he doesn’t even realise that he is scratching his head with the business end of a loaded and cocked pistol.) JOHN (breathlessly): Are you okay? SHERLOCK (quick fire, still pacing and scratching his head with the gun): Me? Yeah, I’m fine, I’m fine. Fine. (He turns to John, wide-eyed and breathless.) SHERLOCK: That, er ... thing that you, er, that you did – that, um ... (he clears his throat) ... you offered to do. That was, um ... good. JOHN (staring blankly ahead of himself): I’m glad no-one saw that. (Sherlock had temporarily lowered his hand long enough not to be risking accidentally shooting himself in the head, although he had terrible jitters as he held the gun down by his side. Now he lifts the gun again and rubs his chin while looking down at John in confusion.) SHERLOCK: Hmm? JOHN (still not meeting his eyes): You, ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool. People might talk. (Sherlock shrugs.) SHERLOCK: People do little else. (He looks down at John, then grins. John snorts laughter and then leans forward and prepares to stand up. But before he can move, the beam from a sniper’s laser begins to dance over his chest. John looks down at it and his face fills with horror.) JOHN (anguished): Oh ... (A door near the deep end of the pool opens and Jim comes through, clapping his hands together and turning to face our heroes.) JIM (cheerfully): Sorry, boys! I’m soooooo changeable! (John grimaces in disbelief. Sherlock keeps his back to Jim, looking up into the gallery to try and judge how many snipers there might be up there. It’s becoming clear that there are quite a few because there are at least two laser points hovering over John, and at least three more travelling over Sherlock’s body. Jim laughs and spreads his arms wide.) JIM: It is a weakness with me but, to be fair to myself, it is my only weakness. (He lowers his hands and puts them in his pockets. Sherlock turns his head and looks down at John, who lifts his own head to meet his gaze.) JIM: You can’t be allowed to continue. You just can’t. I would try to convince you but ... (he laughs and his voice becomes higher pitched again) ... everything I have to say has already crossed your mind! (Sherlock, who had looked away from John for a moment, now turns and looks down at him again, his face showing no emotion but his eyes screaming a silent request. John responds instantly with a tiny nod, giving him full permission to do whatever he deems necessary.) SHERLOCK (turning to face Jim): Probably my answer has crossed yours. (He raises the pistol and aims it at him. Jim smiles confidently with no fear in his expression. Slowly Sherlock lowers the pistol downwards until it’s pointing directly at the bomb jacket. All three sets of eyes lock onto the jacket, John breathing heavily, Sherlock calm. Jim tilts his head, looking a little anxious for the first time. As Sherlock holds his hand steady, continuing to aim towards the jacket, Jim lifts his head and locks eyes with his nemesis. Sherlock gazes back at him and Jim begins to smile. Sherlock’s eyes narrow slightly.)  And the scream that went up from the viewers in August 2010 as the end credits began to roll still echoes around the universe to this day."
British readers in particular,"  (1) “Dear Jim”: Sherlock is mock-quoting a standard format from a very well-known TV show called “Jim’ll Fix It” which ran on the BBC from 1975 to 1994 and was hosted by Jimmy Savile. Viewers – mostly children – would write to the show and would always begin their letter, “Dear Jim, please can you fix it for me to ...” and would ask for their wildest dream to be met, e.g. to be a train driver for a day, or to meet their favourite athlete, or to work in a chocolate factory for a few hours. Nowadays we would all be writing in and saying, “Dear Jim, please can you fix it for me to meet Benedict Cumberbatch/Martin Freeman,” or “... to be the make-up girl on the next season of ‘Sherlock’,” or “... to be Steve Thompson’s beta reader and point out all his plot inconsistencies to him,” etc. [What? Don’t look at me like that third request is from me ...] In a rather unfortunate piece of timing, within the last couple of weeks (in mid-October 2012 when this transcript was published) the reputation of the late Jimmy Savile has plummeted after terrible allegations have recently surfaced about his behaviour during his years at the BBC. If you haven’t heard of this show before, now is not the time to be googling it.  (2) “Westwood”: Jim is wearing a suit designed by Dame Vivienne Westwood, which will therefore have been very expensive, hence his mock-indignation at John ruffling it up. He directs the comment to Sherlock rather than to John because he knows that Sherlock is more likely to be appreciative of the expense of his clothing."
JIM, D’you mind if I get that?
JIM," Hello? ... Yes, of course it is. What do you want?"
JIM, Sorry. Wrong day to die.
JIM," You’ll be hearing from me, Sherlock."
JOHN, What happened there?
SHERLOCK, Someone changed his mind. The question is: who?
IRENE," Well now. Have you been wicked, Your Highness?"
SULTRY FEMALE VOICE," Yes, Miss Adler."
SHERLOCK, What are you typing?
JOHN, Blog.
SHERLOCK, About?
JOHN, Us.
SHERLOCK, You mean me.
JOHN, Why?
SHERLOCK," Well, you’re typing a lot."
SHERLOCK," Right then. (He walks towards the door.) So, what have we got?"
MAN, My wife seems to be spending a very long time at the office.
SHERLOCK, Boring.
WOMAN, I think my husband might be having an affair.
SHERLOCK, Yes.
SHERLOCK, Boring.
GEEKY YOUNG MAN, But then all the comic books started coming true.
SHERLOCK, Oh. Interesting.
SHERLOCK, ‘Geek Interpreter.’ What’s that?
JOHN, It’s the title.
SHERLOCK, What does it need a title for?
SHERLOCK, Do people actually read your blog?
JOHN, Where d’you think our clients come from?
SHERLOCK, I have a website.
JOHN, In which you enumerate two hundred and forty different types of tobacco ash. Nobody’s reading your website.
JOHN," Right then: dyed blonde hair; no obvious cause of death except for these speckles, whatever they are."
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK, “The Speckled Blonde”?!
LITTLE GIRL, They wouldn’t let us see Granddad when he was dead. Is that ’cause he’d gone to heaven?
SHERLOCK, People don’t really go to heaven when they die. They’re taken to a special room and burned.
LESTRADE, There was a plane crash in Dusseldorf yesterday. Everyone dead.
SHERLOCK, Suspected terrorist bomb. We do watch the news.
JOHN," You said, “Boring,” and turned over."
s note," Much as I would love to confirm that “You ... turned over” means that Sherlock turned over in bed, where he and John were watching the news, I reluctantly have to confirm that – in this context – it does sadly mean “You ... changed the channel.” Sorry.]"
JOHN, Lucky escape(!)
SHERLOCK," Okay, four ideas."
SHERLOCK, Maybe two ideas.
JOHN, People want to know you’re human.
SHERLOCK, Why?
JOHN, ’Cause they’re interested.
SHERLOCK, No they’re not. Why are they?
JOHN, Look at that.
JOHN," One thousand, eight hundred and ninety-five."
SHERLOCK," Sorry, what?"
JOHN," I re-set that counter last night. This blog has had nearly two thousand hits in the last eight hours. This is your living, Sherlock – not two hundred and forty different types of tobacco ash."
SHERLOCK," So, what’s this one? “Belly Button Murders”?"
JOHN, “The Navel Treatment”?
SHERLOCK, Eurgh!
LESTRADE," There’s a lot of press outside, guys."
SHERLOCK," Well, they won’t be interested in us."
LESTRADE," Yeah, that was before you were an internet phenomenon. A couple of them specifically wanted photographs of you two."
SHERLOCK, John.
SHERLOCK, Cover your face and walk fast.
LESTRADE," Still, it’s good for the public image, a big case like this."
SHERLOCK, I’m a private detective. The last thing I need is a public image.
man and Robin," The web detectives”, “Sherlock Net ‘Tec”, “Sherlock & John: Blogger Detectives” and “Sherlock Holmes: net phenomenon”. [N.B. see the text of the newspaper articles in the Comments below (click here to jump to the articles).]"
MRS HUDSON, Ooh dear! Thumbs!
MAN, The door was ... the door was ...
MRS HUDSON, Boys! You’ve got another one!
MRS HUDSON, Ooh!
POLICE OFFICER, Sir. Phone call for you.
LESTRADE, Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?
CARTER, Who?
LESTRADE," Well, you’re about to meet him now. This is your case. It’s entirely up to you. This is just friendly advice, but give Sherlock five minutes on your crime scene and listen to everything that he has to say. And as far as possible, try not to punch him."
POLICE OFFICER, Okay.
POLICE OFFICER," Sir, this gentleman says he needs to speak to you."
CARTER," Yes, I know. (He walks closer to the car.) Sherlock Holmes."
SHERLOCK," Now, show me to the stream."
SHERLOCK," Look, this is a six."
JOHN, When did we agree that?
SHERLOCK, We agreed it yesterday. Stop!
SHERLOCK, Closer.
JOHN, I wasn’t even at home yesterday. I was in Dublin.
SHERLOCK," Well, it’s hardly my fault you weren’t listening."
JOHN, D’you just carry on talking when I’m away?
JOHN, It’s there.
SHERLOCK," That’s the one that made the noise, yes?"
CARTER," You’ve got two more minutes, then I want to know more about the driver."
CARTER, I think he’s a suspect!
SHERLOCK, Pass me over.
JOHN," All right, but there’s a Mute button and I will use it."
JOHN," Okay, just take it, take it."
CARTER, He’s trying to be clever. It’s over-confidence.
SHERLOCK, Don’t worry – this is just stupid.
SHERLOCK, Go to the stream.
CARTER, What’s in the stream?
SHERLOCK, Go and see.
MRS HUDSON, Sherlock! You weren’t answering your doorbell!
PLUMMER, His room’s through the back. Get him some clothes.
SHERLOCK, Who the hell are you?
PLUMMER," Sorry, Mr Holmes. You’re coming with us."
JOHN," Sherlock, what’s going on? What’s happening?"
JOHN, I’ve lost him. I don’t know what ...
POLICE OFFICER, Doctor Watson?
JOHN, Yeah.
POLICE OFFICER, It’s for you.
JOHN," Okay, thanks."
POLICE OFFICER," Uh, no, sir. The helicopter."
PLUMMER," Please, Mr Holmes. Where you’re going, you’ll want to be dressed."

SHERLOCK," Oh, I know exactly where I’m going."
JOHN, Are you wearing any pants?
SHERLOCK, No.
JOHN, Okay.
JOHN," What are we doing here, Sherlock? Seriously, what?"
JOHN, Here to see the Queen?
SHERLOCK," Oh, apparently yes."
MYCROFT," Just once, can you two behave like grown-ups?"
JOHN," We solve crimes, I blog about it and he forgets his pants, so I wouldn’t hold out too much hope."
SHERLOCK," I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft."
MYCROFT," What, the hiker and the backfire? I glanced at the police report. Bit obvious, surely?"
SHERLOCK, Transparent.
MYCROFT," Time to move on, then."
MYCROFT," We are in Buckingham Palace, the very heart of the British nation. (Sternly) Sherlock Holmes, put your trousers on."
MYCROFT, Your client.
EQUERRY, Illustrious ...
EQUERRY, ... in the extreme.
EQUERRY, And remaining – I have to inform you – entirely anonymous.
EQUERRY, Mycroft!
MYCROFT, Harry.
MYCROFT, May I just apologise for the state of my little brother?
EQUERRY," Full-time occupation, I imagine."
EQUERRY," And this must be Doctor John Watson, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers."
JOHN," Hello, yes."
EQUERRY, My employer is a tremendous fan of your blog.
EQUERRY, Particularly enjoyed the one about the aluminium crutch.
JOHN, Thank you!
SHERLOCK, I take the precaution of a good coat and a short friend.
SHERLOCK," Mycroft, I don’t do anonymous clients. I’m used to mystery at one end of my cases. Both ends is too much work."
SHERLOCK, Good morning.
MYCROFT, This is a matter of national importance. Grow up.
SHERLOCK, Get off my sheet!
MYCROFT, Or what?
SHERLOCK, Or I’ll just walk away.
MYCROFT, I’ll let you.
JOHN," Boys, please. Not here."
MYCROFT, Take a look at where you’re standing and make a deduction. You are to be engaged by the highest in the land. Now for God’s sake ...
MYCROFT, I’ll be mother.
EQUERRY, My employer has a problem.
MYCROFT," A matter has come to light of an extremely delicate and potentially criminal nature, and in this hour of need, dear brother, your name has arisen."
SHERLOCK," Why? You have a police force of sorts, even a marginally Secret Service. Why come to me?"
EQUERRY," People do come to you for help, don’t they, Mr Holmes?"
SHERLOCK," Not, to date, anyone with a Navy."
MYCROFT," This is a matter of the highest security, and therefore of trust."
JOHN, You don’t trust your own Secret Service?
MYCROFT, Naturally not. They all spy on people for money.
EQUERRY, I do think we have a timetable.
MYCROFT," Yes, of course. Um ..."
MYCROFT, What do you know about this woman?
SHERLOCK, Nothing whatsoever.
MYCROFT, Then you should be paying more attention.
MYCROFT," She’s been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year, and recently ended the marriage of a prominent novelist by having an affair with both participants separately."
SHERLOCK, You know I don’t concern myself with trivia. Who is she?
MYCROFT," Irene Adler, professionally known as The Woman."
JOHN, Professionally?
MYCROFT, There are many names for what she does. She prefers ‘dominatrix.’
MYCROFT, Don’t be alarmed. It’s to do with sex.
SHERLOCK, Sex doesn’t alarm me.
MYCROFT, She provides – shall we say – recreational scolding for those who enjoy that sort of thing and are prepared to pay for it. (He takes more photographs from his briefcase and hands them to Sherlock.) These are all from her website.
SHERLOCK, And I assume this Adler woman has some compromising photographs.
EQUERRY," You’re very quick, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK, Hardly a difficult deduction. Photographs of whom?
EQUERRY, A person of significance to my employer. We’d prefer not to say any more at this time.
JOHN, You can’t tell us anything?
MYCROFT, I can tell you it’s a young person.
MYCROFT, A young female person.
SHERLOCK, How many photographs?
MYCROFT," A considerable number, apparently."
SHERLOCK, Do Miss Adler and this young female person appear in these photographs together?
MYCROFT," Yes, they do."
SHERLOCK, And I assume in a number of compromising scenarios.
MYCROFT," An imaginative range, we are assured."
SHERLOCK," John, you might want to put that cup back in your saucer now."
EQUERRY," Can you help us, Mr Holmes?"
SHERLOCK, How?
EQUERRY, Will you take the case?
SHERLOCK," What case? Pay her, now and in full. As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead, “Know when you are beaten.”"
MYCROFT, She doesn’t want anything.
MYCROFT," She got in touch, she informed us that the photographs existed, she indicated that she had no intention to use them to extort either money or favour."
JOHN, Sherlock ...
SHERLOCK, Hmm.
SHERLOCK, Where is she?
MYCROFT," Uh, in London currently. She’s staying ..."
SHERLOCK, Text me the details. I’ll be in touch by the end of the day.
EQUERRY, Do you really think you’ll have news by then?
EQUERRY, One can only hope you’re as good as you seem to think.
SHERLOCK," I’ll need some equipment, of course."
MYCROFT, Anything you require. I’ll have it sent to ...
EQUERRY, I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK, Or your cigarette lighter. Either will do.
EQUERRY, I don’t smoke.
SHERLOCK," No, I know you don’t, but your employer does."
EQUERRY," We have kept a lot of people successfully in the dark about this little fact, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK, I’m not the Commonwealth.
JOHN," Okay, the smoking. How did you know?"
SHERLOCK," The evidence was right under your nose, John. As ever, you see but do not observe."
JOHN, Observe what?
SHERLOCK, The ashtray.
IRENE, Kate!
IRENE, We’re going to have a visitor. I’ll need a bit of time to get ready.
KATE, A long time?
IRENE, Ages!
JOHN, What are you doing?
SHERLOCK," Going into battle, John. I need the right armour."
SHERLOCK, No.
IRENE, Nah.
IRENE, Everything works on you.
JOHN," So, what’s the plan?"
SHERLOCK, We know her address.
JOHN," What, just ring her doorbell?"
SHERLOCK, Exactly.
SHERLOCK," Just here, please."
JOHN, You didn’t even change your clothes.
SHERLOCK, Then it’s time to add a splash of colour.
JOHN, Are we here?
SHERLOCK," Two streets away, but this’ll do."
JOHN, For what?
KATE, Shade?
IRENE, Blood.
JOHN, Punch you?
SHERLOCK," Yes. Punch me, in the face. (He gestures to his left cheek again.) Didn’t you hear me?"
JOHN," I always hear ‘punch me in the face’ when you’re speaking, but it’s usually sub-text."
JOHN, Ow!
SHERLOCK, Thank you. That was – that was ...
 Sherlock, I was a soldier. I killed people.
SHERLOCK, You were a doctor!
JOHN, I had bad days!
KATE, What are you gonna wear?
IRENE, My battle dress.
KATE, Ooh! Lucky boy!
SHERLOCK," Ooh! Um, sorry to disturb you. Um, I’ve just been attacked, um, and, um, I think they ... they took my wallet and, um, and my phone. Umm, please could you help me?"
KATE, I can phone the police if you want.
SHERLOCK," Oh, would you ... would you mind if I just waited here, just until they come? Thank you. Thank you so much."
JOHN," Now, have you got a first aid kit?"
KATE, In the kitchen.
KATE, Please.
SHERLOCK, Oh! Thank you!
JOHN, Thank you. (He follows Kate towards the kitchen.)
IRENE," Oh, it’s always hard to remember an alias when you’ve had a fright, isn’t it? "
IRENE, There now – we’re both defrocked ... 
IRENE, ... Mr Sherlock Holmes. 
JOHN," Right, this should do it. "
JOHN," I’ve missed something, haven’t I? "
IRENE," Please, sit down. "
IRENE," Oh, if you’d like some tea I can call the maid. "
SHERLOCK, I had some at the Palace. 
IRENE, I know. 
SHERLOCK, Clearly. 
JOHN," I had a tea, too, at the Palace, if anyone’s interested. "
 His final analysis is as follows, 
 he turns and looks at John and starts to analyse him, 
Looking at his neckline, Two Day Shirt 
Looking at his lower face, Electric not blade 
Looking at the bottom of his jeans and his shoes, Date tonight 
s right eyebrow, Hasn’t phoned sister 
s lower lip, New toothbrush 
Looking just underneath his eyes, Night out with Stamford 
 and he quickly comes to the following conclusion, 
IRENE," D’you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr Holmes? "
IRENE," However hard you try, it’s always a self-portrait. "
SHERLOCK, You think I’m a vicar with a bleeding face? 
IRENE," No, I think you’re damaged, delusional and believe in a higher power. In your case, it’s yourself. "
IRENE," Oh, and somebody loves you. Why, if I had to punch that face, I’d avoid your nose and teeth too. "
JOHN," Could you put something on, please? Er, anything at all. (He looks down at what he’s holding.) A napkin. "
IRENE, Why? Are you feeling exposed? 
IRENE," No, I think he knows exactly where. "
SHERLOCK, If I wanted to look at naked women I’d borrow John’s laptop. 
JOHN, You do borrow my laptop. 
SHERLOCK, I confiscate it. 
IRENE, How was it done? 
SHERLOCK, What? 
SHERLOCK, That’s not why I’m here. 
IRENE," No, no, no, you’re here for the photographs but that’s never gonna happen, and since we’re here just chatting anyway ... "
JOHN, That story’s not been on the news yet. How do you know about it? 
IRENE," I know one of the policemen. Well, I know what he likes. "
JOHN, Oh. (He sits down beside her.) And you like policemen? 
IRENE, I like detective stories – and detectives. Brainy’s the new sexy. 
IRENE," Okay, tell me: how was he murdered? "
SHERLOCK, He wasn’t. 
IRENE, You don’t think it was murder? 
SHERLOCK, I know it wasn’t. 
IRENE, How? 
SHERLOCK, The same way that I know the victim was an excellent sportsman recently returned from foreign travel and that the photographs I’m looking for are in this room. 
IRENE," Okay, but how? "
SHERLOCK," So they are in this room. Thank you. John, man the door. Let no-one in. "
IRENE, Oh. I – I thought you were looking for the photos now. 
SHERLOCK," No, no. Looking takes ages. I’m just going to find them but you’re moderately clever and we’ve got a moment, so let’s pass the time. "
SHERLOCK," Two men, a car, and nobody else. "
SHERLOCK, The driver’s trying to fix his engine. Getting nowhere. 
SHERLOCK," And the hiker’s taking a moment, looking at the sky. "
SHERLOCK, Watching the birds? 
SHERLOCK," Any moment now, something’s gonna happen. What? "
IRENE, The hiker’s going to die. 
SHERLOCK," No, that’s the result. What’s going to happen? "
IRENE, I don’t understand. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, well, try to. "
IRENE, Why? 
SHERLOCK, Because you cater to the whims of the pathetic and take your clothes off to make an impression. Stop boring me and think. (Sarcastically) It’s the new sexy. 
IRENE, The car’s going to backfire. 
SHERLOCK, There’s going to be a loud noise. 
IRENE," So, what? "
SHERLOCK," Oh, noises are important. Noises can tell you everything. For instance ... "
SHERLOCK," Thank you. On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look towards her child. Amazing how fire exposes our priorities. "
SHERLOCK, Really hope you don’t have a baby in here. 
SHERLOCK," All right, John, you can turn it off now. "
JOHN, Give me a minute. 
JOHN, Thank you. 
SHERLOCK," Hmm. Should always use gloves with these things, you know. Heaviest oil deposit’s always on the first key used – that’s quite clearly the three – but after that the sequence is almost impossible to read. I’d say from the make that it’s a six digit code. Can’t be your birthday – no disrespect but clearly you were born in the eighties; the eight’s barely used, so ... "
IRENE, I’d tell you the code right now but you know what? I already have. 
IRENE, Think. 
NEILSON, Hands behind your head. (To Irene) On the floor. Keep it still. 
JOHN," Sorry, Sherlock. "
NEILSON," Ms Adler, on the floor. "
SHERLOCK, Don’t you want me on the floor too? 
NEILSON," No, sir, I want you to open the safe. "
NEILSON," Sir, the safe, now, please. "
SHERLOCK, I don’t know the code. 
NEILSON, We’ve been listening. She said she told you. 
SHERLOCK," Well, if you’d been listening, you’d know she didn’t. "
NEILSON," I’m assuming I missed something. From your reputation, I’m assuming you didn’t, Mr Holmes. "
JOHN, For God’s sake. She’s the one who knows the code. Ask her. 
NEILSON," Yes, sir. She also knows the code that automatically calls the police and sets off the burglar alarm. I’ve learned not to trust this woman. "
IRENE, Mr Holmes doesn’t ... 
NEILSON," Shut up. One more word out of you – just one – and I will decorate that wall with the insides of your head. That, for me, will not be a hardship. "
NEILSON," Mr Archer. At the count of three, shoot Doctor Watson. "
JOHN, What? 
SHERLOCK, I don’t have the code. 
NEILSON, One. 
NEILSON, Two. 
SHERLOCK, She didn’t tell me. (Raising his voice) I don’t know it! 
NEILSON, I’m prepared to believe you any second now. 
NEILSON, Three. 
SHERLOCK," No, stop! "
NEILSON," Thank you, Mr Holmes. Open it, please. "
SHERLOCK, D’you mind? 
IRENE, Not at all. 
JOHN, He’s dead. 
JOHN, Observant? 
IRENE, I’m flattered. 
SHERLOCK, Don’t be. 
JOHN, Flattered? 
SHERLOCK, There’ll be more of them. They’ll be keeping a eye on the building. 
JOHN, We should call the police. 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
SHERLOCK, On their way. 
JOHN, For God’s sake! 
SHERLOCK, Oh shut up. It’s quick. 
SHERLOCK," Well, that’s the knighthood in the bag. "
IRENE, Ah. And that’s mine. 
SHERLOCK," All the photographs are on here, I presume. "
IRENE," I have copies, of course. "
SHERLOCK," No you don’t. You’ll have permanently disabled any kind of uplink or connection. Unless the contents of this phone are provably unique, you wouldn’t be able to sell them. "
IRENE," That camera phone is my life, Mr Holmes. I’d die before I let you take it. (She walks closer and holds her hand out again.) It’s my protection. "
JOHN, Must have come in this way. 
SHERLOCK, Clearly. 
JOHN, It’s all right. She’s just out cold. 
IRENE," Well, God knows she’s used to that. There’s a back door. Better check it, Doctor Watson. "
JOHN, Sure. 
SHERLOCK, You’re very calm. 
SHERLOCK," Well, your booby trap did just kill a man. "
IRENE, He would have killed me. It was self defence in advance. 
SHERLOCK, What? What is that? What ...? 
IRENE, Give it to me. Now. Give it to me. 
SHERLOCK, No. 
IRENE, Give it to me. 
SHERLOCK, No. 
IRENE," Oh, for goodness’ sake. "
IRENE, Drop it. 
IRENE, I ... (she thrashes him) ... said ... (she thrashes him again) ... drop it. 
IRENE," Ah. Thank you, dear. "
IRENE," Now tell that sweet little posh thing the pictures are safe with me. They’re not for blackmail, just for insurance. "
IRENE," Besides, I might want to see her again. "
IRENE," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It’s been a pleasure. Don’t spoil it. "
IRENE, This is how I want you to remember me. The woman who beat you. 
IRENE," Goodnight, Mr Sherlock Holmes. "
JOHN, Jesus. What are you doing? 
IRENE, He’ll sleep for a few hours. Make sure he doesn’t choke on his own vomit. It makes for a very unattractive corpse. 
IRENE, He’ll be fine. I’ve used it on loads of my friends. 
IRENE," You know, I was wrong about him. He did know where to look. "
IRENE, The key code to my safe. 
JOHN, What was it? 
IRENE, Shall I tell him? 
IRENE, My measurements. 
IRENE, Got it! 
IRENE," Oh, shush now. Don’t get up. I’ll do the talking. "
IRENE, So the car’s about to backfire ... 
IRENE," ... and the hiker, he’s staring at the sky. Now, you said he could be watching birds but he wasn’t, was he? "
IRENE, He was watching another kind of flying thing. The car backfires and the hiker turns to look ... 
IRENE, ... which was his big mistake. 
IRENE," By the time the driver looks up, the hiker’s already dead. What he doesn’t see is what killed him because it’s already being washed downstream. "
IRENE, An accomplished sportsman recently returned from foreign travel with ... a boomerang. You got that from one look? Definitely the new sexy. 
SHERLOCK, I ... 
SHERLOCK, John? 
JOHN, You okay? 
SHERLOCK, How did I get here? 
JOHN," Well, I don’t suppose you remember much. You weren’t making a lot of sense. Oh, I should warn you: I think Lestrade filmed you on his phone. "
JOHN, Where’s who? 
SHERLOCK, The woman. That woman. 
JOHN, What woman? 
JOHN," What, Irene Adler? She got away. No-one saw her. "
JOHN," She wasn’t here, Sherlock. "
JOHN," What are you ...? What ...? No, no, no, no. "
JOHN, Back to bed. (He covers him over with the sheet.) You’ll be fine in the morning. Just sleep. 
JOHN," Yes, you’re great. Now I’ll be next door if you need me. "
JOHN, No reason at all. 
 A new text message reads, 
SHERLOCK, The photographs are perfectly safe. 
MYCROFT, In the hands of a fugitive sex worker. 
SHERLOCK, She’s not interested in blackmail. She wants ... protection for some reason. I take it you’ve stood down the police investigation into the shooting at her house? 
MYCROFT, How can we do anything while she has the photographs? Our hands are tied. 
SHERLOCK, She’d applaud your choice of words. 
SHERLOCK," You see how this works: that camera phone is her “Get out of jail free” card. You have to leave her alone. Treat her like royalty, Mycroft. "
JOHN, Though not the way she treats royalty. 
JOHN, What was that? 
JOHN, But what was that noise? 
 He looks at the message which reads, 
SHERLOCK," Did you know there were other people after her too, Mycroft, before you sent John and I in there? CIA-trained killers, at an excellent guess. "
JOHN," Yeah, thanks for that, Mycroft. "
MYCROFT," Oh, shut up, Mrs Hudson. "
MYCROFT, Apologies. 
MRS HUDSON, Thank you. 
SHERLOCK," Though do, in fact, shut up. "
MRS HUDSON," Ooh. It’s a bit rude, that noise, isn’t it? "
Sherlock looks at the latest message which reads, 
SHERLOCK, There’s nothing you can do and nothing she will do as far as I can see. 
MYCROFT, I can put maximum surveillance on her. 
SHERLOCK, Why bother? You can follow her on Twitter. I believe her user name is “TheWhipHand.” 
MYCROFT, Yes. Most amusing. 
MYCROFT, ’Scuse me. 
JOHN, Why does your phone make that noise? 
SHERLOCK, What noise? 
JOHN, That noise – the one it just made. 
SHERLOCK, It’s a text alert. It means I’ve got a text. 
JOHN, Hmm. Your texts don’t usually make that noise. 
SHERLOCK," Well, somebody got hold of the phone and apparently, as a joke, personalised their text alert noise. "
JOHN, Hmm. So every time they text you ... 
SHERLOCK, It would seem so. 
MRS HUDSON," Could you turn that phone down a bit? At my time of life, it’s ... "
The latest text message reads, 
JOHN," I’m wondering who could have got hold of your phone, because it would have been in your coat, wouldn’t it? "
SHERLOCK, I’ll leave you to your deductions. 
JOHN," I’m not stupid, you know. "
SHERLOCK, Where do you get that idea? 
MYCROFT," Bond Air is go, that’s decided. Check with the Coventry lot. Talk later. "
SHERLOCK, What else does she have? 
SHERLOCK, Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn’t be interested in her for a couple of compromising photographs. There’s more. 
SHERLOCK, Much more. 
SHERLOCK," Something big’s coming, isn’t it? "
MYCROFT, Irene Adler is no longer any concern of yours. From now on you will stay out of this. 
MYCROFT," Yes, Sherlock, you will. "
MYCROFT," Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a long and arduous apology to make to a very old friend. "
MRS HUDSON," Lovely! Sherlock, that was lovely! "
JOHN, Marvellous! 
MRS HUDSON, I wish you could have worn the antlers! 
SHERLOCK," Some things are best left to the imagination, Mrs Hudson. "
JOHN," Uh, no, no, no, no, no. He’s not good with names. "
SHERLOCK," No-no-no, I can get this. "
SHERLOCK," No, Sarah was the doctor; and then there was the one with the spots; and then the one with the nose; and then ... who was after the boring teacher? "
JEANETTE, Nobody. 
SHERLOCK," Jeanette! (He grins falsely at her.) Ah, process of elimination. "
SHERLOCK," Oh, dear Lord. "
MOLLY," Hello, everyone. Sorry, hello. "
MOLLY," Er, it said on the door just to come up. "
SHERLOCK," Oh, everybody’s saying hullo to each other. How wonderful(!) "
LESTRADE, Wow! 
MOLLY," Having a Christmas drinkies, then? "
MRS HUDSON," It’s the one day of the year where the boys have to be nice to me, so it’s almost worth it! "
JOHN, Have a seat. 
SHERLOCK, John? 
JOHN, Mmm? 
LESTRADE, Molly? (She turns to him.) Want a drink? 
SHERLOCK, The counter on your blog: still says one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five. 
SHERLOCK, And you’ve got a photograph of me wearing that hat! 
JOHN, People like the hat. 
SHERLOCK, No they don’t. What people? 
MOLLY, How’s the hip? 
MRS HUDSON," Ooh, it’s atrocious, but thanks for asking. "
MOLLY," I’ve seen much worse, but then I do post-mortems. "
MOLLY," Oh, God. Sorry. "
SHERLOCK," Don’t make jokes, Molly. "
MOLLY, No. Sorry. 
MOLLY, Thank you. I wasn’t expecting to see you. I thought you were gonna be in Dorset for Christmas. 
LESTRADE," That’s first thing in the morning, me and the wife. We’re back together. It’s all sorted. "
MOLLY," And John. I hear you’re off to your sister’s, is that right? "
JOHN, Yeah. 
MOLLY, Sherlock was complaining. 
MOLLY, ... saying. 
JOHN," First time ever, she’s cleaned up her act. She’s off the booze. "
SHERLOCK, Nope. 
JOHN," Shut up, Sherlock. "
SHERLOCK," I see you’ve got a new boyfriend, Molly, and you’re serious about him. "
MOLLY," Sorry, what? "
SHERLOCK," In fact, you’re seeing him this very night and giving him a gift. "
SHERLOCK," Oh, come on. Surely you’ve all seen the present at the top of the bag – perfectly wrapped with a bow. All the others are slapdash at best. "
SHERLOCK," It’s for someone special, then. "
SHERLOCK," The shade of red echoes her lipstick – either an unconscious association or one that she’s deliberately trying to encourage. Either way, Miss Hooper has lurrrve on her mind. The fact that she’s serious about him is clear from the fact she’s giving him a gift at all. "
SHERLOCK," That would suggest long-term hopes, however forlorn; and that she’s seeing him tonight is evident from her make-up and what she’s wearing. "
SHERLOCK, Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts ... 
 the greeting reads, 
MOLLY, You always say such horrible things. Every time. Always. Always. 
SHERLOCK, I am sorry. Forgive me. 
MOLLY, No! That wasn’t ... I – I didn’t ... 
SHERLOCK," No, it was me. "
LESTRADE," My God, really?! "
MOLLY, What?! 
SHERLOCK, My phone. 
JOHN, Fifty-seven? 
SHERLOCK," Sorry, what? "
JOHN, Fifty-seven of those texts – the ones I’ve heard. 
Sherlock looks at the message which reads simply, 
SHERLOCK, ’Scuse me. 
JOHN," What – what’s up, Sherlock? "
MYCROFT," Oh dear Lord. We’re not going to have Christmas phone calls now, are we? Have they passed a new law? "
SHERLOCK, I think you’re going to find Irene Adler tonight. 
MYCROFT," We already know where she is. As you were kind enough to point out, it hardly matters. "
SHERLOCK," No, I mean you’re going to find her dead. "
JOHN, You okay? 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
SHERLOCK," You didn’t need to come in, Molly. "
MOLLY, That’s okay. Everyone else was busy with ... Christmas. 
MOLLY," The face is a bit, sort of, bashed up, so it might be a bit difficult. "
MYCROFT," That’s her, isn’t it? "
SHERLOCK, That’s her. 
MYCROFT," Thank you, Miss Hooper. "
MOLLY, Who is she? How did Sherlock recognise her from ... not her face? 
MYCROFT, Just the one. 
SHERLOCK, Why? 
MYCROFT, Merry Christmas. 
SHERLOCK, Smoking indoors – isn’t there one of those ... one of those law things? 
MYCROFT, We’re in a morgue. There’s only so much damage you can do. 
MYCROFT, How did you know she was dead? 
SHERLOCK," She had an item in her possession, one she said her life depended on. She chose to give it up. "
MYCROFT, Where is this item now? 
SHERLOCK, Look at them. They all care so much. Do you ever wonder if there’s something wrong with us? 
MYCROFT," All lives end. All hearts are broken. (He looks round at his brother.) Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock. "
SHERLOCK, This is low tar. 
MYCROFT," Well, you barely knew her. "
SHERLOCK, Huh! 
SHERLOCK," Merry Christmas, Mycroft. "
MYCROFT, And a happy New Year. 
MYCROFT, Have you found anything? 
JOHN, No. Did he take the cigarette? 
MYCROFT, Yes. 
JOHN, Shit. (He looks round to Mrs Hudson.) He’s coming. Ten minutes. 
MRS HUDSON, There’s nothing in the bedroom. 
MYCROFT," No, but then I never am. You have to stay with him, John. "
JOHN, I’ve got plans. 
MYCROFT, No. 
JOHN, Mycroft. M... 
JOHN, I am really sorry. 
JEANETTE," You know, my friends are so wrong about you. "
JOHN, Hmm? 
JEANETTE, You’re a great boyfriend. 
JEANETTE, And Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man. 
JOHN," Jeanette, please. "
JOHN," No, I’ll do anything for you. Just tell me what it is I’m not doing. Tell me! "
JEANETTE, Don’t make me compete with Sherlock Holmes. 
JOHN," I’ll walk your dog for you. Hey, I’ve said it now. I’ll even walk your dog ... "
JEANETTE, I don’t have a dog! 
JOHN," No, because that was ... the last one. Okay. "
JEANETTE, Jesus! 
JOHN, I’ll call you. 
JEANETTE, No! 
JOHN, Okay. 
MRS HUDSON," That really wasn’t very good, was it? "
JOHN," Oh, hi. "
JOHN, You okay? 
SHERLOCK, Hope you didn’t mess up my sock index this time. 
MRS HUDSON," Lovely tune, Sherlock. Haven’t heard that one before. "
JOHN, You composing? 
SHERLOCK, Helps me to think. 
JOHN, What are you thinking about? 
JOHN," Yeah, it’s faulty. Can’t seem to fix it. "
JOHN, Hmm? 
 The phone beeps warningly and a message comes up reading, “WRONG PASSCODE. 3 ATTEMPTS REMAINING”. The enthusiasm in his eyes dies again.) 
SHERLOCK, Just faulty. 
JOHN, Right. 
JOHN," Right. Well, I’m going out for a bit. "
 Listen," has he ever had any kind of ... (he sighs) ... girlfriend, boyfriend, a relationship, ever? "
MRS HUDSON, I don’t know. 
MRS HUDSON, He’s Sherlock. How will we ever know what goes on in that funny old head? 
JOHN, Right. See ya. 
WOMAN, John? 
JOHN, Yeah. 
JOHN, Hello. 
JOHN, Hello! 
JOHN," Er, nothing fixed. Nothing I couldn’t heartlessly abandon. You have any ideas? "
WOMAN, One. 
JOHN," You know, Mycroft could just phone me, if he didn’t have this bloody stupid power complex. "
JOHN, Couldn’t we just go to a café? Sherlock doesn’t follow me everywhere. 
WOMAN, Through there. 
JOHN, He’s writing sad music; doesn’t eat; barely talks – only to correct the television. 
JOHN," I’d say he was heartbroken but, er, well, he’s Sherlock. He does all that anyw... "
IRENE," Hello, Doctor Watson. "
JOHN, I’ll come after you if you don’t. 
IRENE," Mmm, I believe you. "
IRENE, DNA tests are only as good as the records you keep. 
JOHN, And I bet you know the record-keeper. 
IRENE," I know what he likes, and I needed to disappear. "
JOHN," Then how come I can see you, and I don’t even want to? "
IRENE," Look, I made a mistake. I sent something to Sherlock for safe-keeping and now I need it back, so I need your help. "
JOHN, No. 
IRENE, It’s for his own safety. 
JOHN, So’s this: tell him you’re alive. 
IRENE, I can’t. 
IRENE, What do I say? 
IRENE, Just the usual stuff. 
JOHN, There is no ‘usual’ in this case. 
IRENE, “Good morning”; “I like your funny hat”; “I’m sad tonight. Let’s have dinner” ... 
IRENE," ... “You looked sexy on ‘Crimewatch.’ Let’s have dinner”; “I’m not hungry, let’s have dinner”. "
JOHN, You ... flirted with Sherlock Holmes?! 
JOHN," No, Sherlock always replies – to everything. He’s Mr Punchline. He will outlive God trying to have the last word. "
IRENE, Does that make me special? 
JOHN, ... I don’t know. Maybe. 
IRENE, Are you jealous? 
JOHN, We’re not a couple. 
IRENE, Yes you are. There ... 
IRENE, “I’m not dead. Let’s have dinner.” 
IRENE," Well, I am. Look at us both. "
IRENE," I don’t think so, do you? "
re cleaning materials," a pair of rubber gloves, a duster, a spray can of what is probably screen and telephone sanitizer, a toilet brush and a bottle of disinfectant, and a couple of other items. "
MRS HUDSON," Oh, Sherlock, Sherlock! "
SHERLOCK," Don’t snivel, Mrs Hudson. It’ll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet. "
SHERLOCK, What a tender world that would be. 
NEILSON," I believe you have something that we want, Mr Holmes. "
SHERLOCK, Then why don’t you ask for it? 
NEILSON, I’ve been asking this one. She doesn’t seem to know anything. 
NEILSON," But you know what I’m asking for, don’t you, Mr Holmes? "
 In very rapid succession he is picking out target points on his body, 
s arm and chest, 
SHERLOCK, I believe I do. 
MRS HUDSON," Oh, please, Sherlock. "
NEILSON, Why? 
SHERLOCK, I dislike being outnumbered. It makes for too much stupid in the room. 
NEILSON," You two, go to the car. "
SHERLOCK, Then get into the car and drive away. (He looks back to Neilson.) Don’t try to trick me. You know who I am. It doesn’t work. 
SHERLOCK," Next, you can stop pointing that gun at me. "
NEILSON, So you can point a gun at me? 
NEILSON, Mind if I check? 
SHERLOCK," Oh, I insist. "
MRS HUDSON, Don’t do anything. 
SHERLOCK, Moron. 
MRS HUDSON, Yes. 
 Written on the note is, 
JOHN, What’s going on? 
JOHN, Jeez. What the hell is happening? 
SHERLOCK, Mrs Hudson’s been attacked by an American. I’m restoring balance to the universe. 
JOHN," Oh, Mrs Hudson, my God. Are you all right? (Glaring at Neilson as he puts his arm around her shoulders) Jesus, what have they done to you? "
JOHN, Are you gonna tell me what’s going on? 
SHERLOCK, I expect so. Now go. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, a few broken ribs, fractured skull ... suspected punctured lung. "
MRS HUDSON," Ooh, it stings. "
MRS HUDSON, Ooh. That was right on my bins. 
LESTRADE, And exactly how many times did he fall out the window? 
SHERLOCK," It’s all a bit of a blur, Detective Inspector. I lost count. "
JOHN, She’ll have to sleep upstairs in our flat tonight. We need to look after her. 
MRS HUDSON, No. 
SHERLOCK," Of course, but she’s fine. "
JOHN," No, she’s not. Look at her. "
JOHN, She’s got to take some time away from Baker Street. She can go and stay with her sister. Doctor’s orders. 
SHERLOCK, Don’t be absurd. 
JOHN," She’s in shock, for God’s sake, and all over some bloody stupid camera phone. Where is it, anyway? "
SHERLOCK, Safest place I know. 
MRS HUDSON," You left it in the pocket of your second-best dressing gown, you clot. (She laughs briefly.) I managed to sneak it out when they thought I was having a cry. "
SHERLOCK," Shame on you, John Watson. "
JOHN, Shame on me?! 
SHERLOCK, Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street? 
JOHN, Where is it now? 
SHERLOCK, Where no-one will look. 
JOHN, Whatever’s on that phone is more than just pictures. 
SHERLOCK," Yes, it is. "
JOHN," So, she’s alive then. How are we feeling about that? "
SHERLOCK," Happy New Year, John. "
JOHN, Do you think you’ll be seeing her again? 
 she sees that it reads, 
MOLLY, Is that a phone? 
SHERLOCK, It’s a camera phone. 
MOLLY, And you’re X-raying it? 
SHERLOCK," Yes, I am. "
MOLLY, Whose phone is it? 
SHERLOCK, A woman’s. 
MOLLY, Your girlfriend? 
SHERLOCK, You think she’s my girlfriend because I’m X-raying her possessions? 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
SHERLOCK," They do, don’t they? Very silly. "
SHERLOCK," She sent this to my address, and she loves to play games. "
MOLLY, She does? 
 The phone beeps warningly and a message comes up reading, “WRONG PASSCODE. 2 ATTEMPTS REMAINING”. He looks exasperated and sits down again.) 
JOHN, Sherlock ... 
SHERLOCK, We have a client. 
JOHN," What, in your bedroom?! "
JOHN, Ohhh. 
SHERLOCK, So who’s after you? 
IRENE, People who want to kill me. 
SHERLOCK, Who’s that? 
IRENE, Killers. 
JOHN, It would help if you were a tiny bit more specific. 
SHERLOCK, So you faked your own death in order to get ahead of them. 
IRENE, It worked for a while. 
SHERLOCK," Except you let John know that you were alive, and therefore me. "
IRENE, I knew you’d keep my secret. 
SHERLOCK, You couldn’t. 
IRENE," But you did, didn’t you? Where’s my camera phone? "
JOHN, It’s not here. We’re not stupid. 
IRENE," Then what have you done with it? If they’ve guessed you’ve got it, they’ll be watching you. "
SHERLOCK," If they’ve been watching me, they’ll know that I took a safety deposit box at a bank on the Strand a few months ago. "
IRENE, I need it. 
JOHN," Well, we can’t just go and get it, can we? "
JOHN," Molly Hooper. She could collect it, take it to Bart’s; then one of your homeless network could bring it here, leave it in the café, and one of the boys downstairs could bring it up the back. "
JOHN," Thank you. (He picks up his phone.) So, why don’t ... Oh, for ... "
SHERLOCK," So what do you keep on here – in general, I mean? "
IRENE," Pictures, information, anything I might find useful. "
JOHN," What, for blackmail? "
IRENE, For protection. I make my way in the world; I misbehave. I like to know people will be on my side exactly when I need them to be. 
SHERLOCK, So how do you acquire this information? 
IRENE, I told you – I misbehave. 
SHERLOCK, But you’ve acquired something that’s more danger than protection. Do you know what it is? 
IRENE," Yes, but I don’t understand it. "
SHERLOCK, I assumed. Show me. 
SHERLOCK, The passcode. 
IRENE, It’s not working. 
SHERLOCK," I assumed you’d choose something more specific than that but, um, thanks anyway. "
 He looks at her smugly but then the phone beeps warningly and a message comes up reading, “WRONG PASSCODE. 1 ATTEMPT REMAINING”. He stares in disbelief.) 
IRENE, I told you that camera phone was my life. I know when it’s in my hand. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, you’re rather good. "
JOHN, John Hamish Watson – just if you were looking for baby names. 
IRENE, There was a man – an MOD official. I knew what he liked. 
IRENE," One of the things he liked was showing off. He told me this email was going to save the world. He didn’t know it, but I photographed it. (She hands the phone to Sherlock.) He was a bit tied up at the time. It’s a bit small on that screen – can you read it? "
 reads, 
Underneath in smaller print is a string of numbers, 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
IRENE," A code, obviously. I had one of the best cryptographers in the country take a look at it – though he was mostly upside down, as I recall. Couldn’t figure it out. "
IRENE," What can you do, Mr Holmes? "
IRENE, Go on. Impress a girl. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, come on. It’s not code. These are seat allocations on a passenger jet. Look ... "
SHERLOCK, I’ve never begged for mercy in my life. 
JOHN, You’re right. 
SHERLOCK," No, no, no, after that. What did you say after that? "
JOHN, Double oh seven. Flight double oh seven. 
SHERLOCK, ... something ... something connected to double oh seven ... What? 
 Irene puts her other phone behind her back and begins to type blind on it, 
 at Westminster Jim is typing a message onto his phone, 
 It reads, 
SHERLOCK, Coventry. 
IRENE, I’ve never been. Is it nice? 
SHERLOCK, Where’s John? 
IRENE, He went out a couple of hours ago. 
SHERLOCK, I was just talking to him. 
SHERLOCK," It’s a story, probably not true. In the Second World War, the Allies knew that Coventry was going to get bombed because they’d broken the German code but they didn’t want the Germans to know that they’d broken the code, so they let it happen anyway. "
IRENE, Have you ever had anyone? 
SHERLOCK, Sorry? 
IRENE," And when I say “had,” I’m being indelicate. "
SHERLOCK, I don’t understand. 
IRENE," Well, I’ll be delicate then. "
IRENE, Let’s have dinner. 
SHERLOCK, Why? 
IRENE, Might be hungry. 
SHERLOCK, I’m not. 
IRENE, Good. 
SHERLOCK, Why would I want to have dinner if I wasn’t hungry? 
IRENE," ... if it was the end of the world, if this was the very last night, would you have dinner with me? "
SHERLOCK, That’s not the end of the world; that’s Mrs Hudson. 
MRS HUDSON," Sherlock, this man was at the door. Is the bell still not working? "
MRS HUDSON, He shot it. 
PLUMMER," Yes, Mr Holmes. "
SHERLOCK," Well, I decline. "
SHERLOCK, There’s going to be a bomb on a passenger jet. The British and American governments know about it but rather than expose the source of that information they’re going to let it happen. The plane will blow up. Coventry all over again. The wheel turns. Nothing is ever new. 
NEILSON, Like putting a bullet in your brain ... sir. 
NEILSON, They’d pin a medal on me if I did ... 
 An overhead light shows more clearly the faces of two men sitting beside each other and Sherlock now realises the truth," they are dead. Although they’re not yet showing any signs of decomposition, their skin is very grey and they’ve clearly been dead for some time. He turns and looks to the passengers on the other side of the aisle, turning on another overhead light to get a better view. The man and woman sitting there are also long dead. As he straightens up, realising that everyone on board the plane must be in the same condition, his brother speaks from the other end of the section.) "
MYCROFT, The Coventry conundrum. 
MYCROFT, What do you think of my solution? 
MYCROFT, The flight of the dead. 
SHERLOCK," The plane blows up mid-air. Mission accomplished for the terrorists. Hundreds of casualties, but nobody dies. "
MYCROFT," Neat, don’t you think? "
MYCROFT, You’ve been stumbling round the fringes of this one for ages – or were you too bored to notice the pattern? 
LITTLE GIRL, They wouldn’t let us see Granddad when he was dead. 
CREEPY GUY, She’s not my real aunt. I know human ash. 
MYCROFT," We ran a similar project with the Germans a while back, though I believe one of our passengers didn’t make the flight. "
MYCROFT," But that’s the deceased for you – late, in every sense of the word. "
SHERLOCK, How’s the plane going to fly? (He answers himself immediately.) Of course: unmanned aircraft. Hardly new. 
MYCROFT," It doesn’t fly. It will never fly. This entire project is cancelled. The terrorist cells have been informed that we know about the bomb. We can’t fool them now. We’ve lost everything. One fragment of one email, and months and years of planning finished. "
SHERLOCK, Your MOD man. 
MYCROFT," That’s all it takes: one lonely naïve man desperate to show off, and a woman clever enough to make him feel special. "
 Because this was textbook," the promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption; then give him a puzzle ... (his voice drops to a whisper while he twirls the end of his umbrella in the air) ... and watch him dance. "
SHERLOCK, Don’t be absurd. 
MYCROFT," Absurd? How quickly did you decipher that email for her? Was it the full minute, or were you really eager to impress? "
IRENE," Mr Holmes, I think we need to talk. "
SHERLOCK, So do I. There are a number of aspects I’m still not quite clear on. 
IRENE," There’s more ... loads more. On this phone I’ve got secrets, pictures and scandals that could topple your whole world. You have no idea how much havoc I can cause and exactly one way to stop me – unless you want to tell your masters that your biggest security leak is your own little brother. "
MYCROFT, We have people who can get into this. 
IRENE, I tested that theory for you. I let Sherlock Holmes try it for six months. 
IRENE," Sherlock, dear, tell him what you found when you X-rayed my camera phone. "
SHERLOCK, Any attempt to open the casing will burn the hard drive. 
IRENE, Explosive. (She looks at Mycroft.) It’s more me. 
IRENE, Take that risk? 
MYCROFT, You have a passcode to open this. I deeply regret to say we have people who can extract it from you. 
SHERLOCK," There will be two passcodes: one to open the phone, one to burn the drive. Even under duress you can’t know which one she’s given you and there will be no point in a second attempt. "
IRENE," He’s good, isn’t he? I should have him on a leash – in fact, I might. "
MYCROFT," We destroy this, then. No-one has the information. "
IRENE, Fine. Good idea ... unless there are lives of British citizens depending on the information you’re about to burn. 
MYCROFT, Are there? 
IRENE, Telling you would be playing fair. I’m not playing any more. 
IRENE, A list of my requests; and some ideas about my protection once they’re granted. 
IRENE, I’d say it wouldn’t blow much of a hole in the wealth of the nation – but then I’d be lying. 
IRENE, I imagine you’d like to sleep on it. 
IRENE, Too bad. 
MYCROFT, You’ve been very ... thorough. I wish our lot were half as good as you. 
IRENE, I can’t take all the credit. Had a bit of help. 
IRENE," Oh, Jim Moriarty sends his love. "
MYCROFT," Yes, he’s been in touch. Seems desperate for my attention ... (his voice becomes more ominous) ... which I’m sure can be arranged. "
IRENE," I had all this stuff, never knew what to do with it. Thank God for the consultant criminal. Gave me a lot of advice about how to play the Holmes boys. D’you know what he calls you? (Softly) The Ice Man ... (she looks across to Sherlock) ... and the Virgin. "
IRENE, Didn’t even ask for anything. I think he just likes to cause trouble. Now that’s my kind of man. 
MYCROFT," And here you are, the dominatrix who brought a nation to its knees. "
MYCROFT, Nicely played. 
SHERLOCK, No. 
IRENE, Sorry? 
SHERLOCK," I said no. Very very close, but no. "
SHERLOCK, You got carried away. The game was too elaborate. You were enjoying yourself too much. 
IRENE, No such thing as too much. 
IRENE, Sentiment? What are you talking about? 
SHERLOCK, You. 
SHERLOCK," When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait. How true of you: the combination to your safe – your measurements; but this ... (he tosses the phone into the air and catches it again) ... this is far more intimate. "
SHERLOCK, This is your heart ... 
SHERLOCK, ... and you should never let it rule your head. 
SHERLOCK, You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you’ve worked for ... 
SHERLOCK," ... but you just couldn’t resist it, could you? "
SHERLOCK, I’ve always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage ... 
SHERLOCK, Thank you for the final proof. 
 Everything I said, it’s not real. (In a whisper) I was just playing the game. 
SHERLOCK, And this is just losing. 
 tears spilling from her eyes as she reads the sequence which says, 
MYCROFT, I’m certain they will. 
SHERLOCK," If you’re feeling kind, lock her up; otherwise let her go. I doubt she’ll survive long without her protection. "
IRENE, Are you expecting me to beg? 
IRENE, Please. 
IRENE, You’re right. 
SHERLOCK, Sorry about dinner. 
JOHN, You don’t smoke. 
MYCROFT, I also don’t frequent cafés. 
JOHN, This the file on Irene Adler? 
MYCROFT," Closed forever. I am about to go and inform my brother – or, if you prefer, you are – that she somehow got herself into a witness protection scheme in America. New name, new identity. She will survive – and thrive – but he will never see her again. "
JOHN, Why would he care? He despised her at the end. Won’t even mention her by name – just “the Woman.” 
MYCROFT," Is that loathing, or a salute? One of a kind; the one woman who matters. "
JOHN, He’s not like that. He doesn’t feel things that way ... I don’t think. 
MYCROFT," My brother has the brain of a scientist or a philosopher, yet he elects to be a detective. What might we deduce about his heart? "
JOHN, I don’t know. 
MYCROFT, Neither do I ... but initially he wanted to be a pirate. 
JOHN," He’ll be okay with this witness protection, never seeing her again. He’ll be fine. "
MYCROFT, I agree. (He breathes in sharply.) That’s why I decided to tell him that. 
JOHN, Instead of what? 
MYCROFT, She’s dead. She was captured by a terrorist cell in Karachi two months ago and beheaded. 
JOHN, It’s definitely her? She’s done this before. 
MYCROFT," I was thorough – this time. It would take Sherlock Holmes to fool me, and I don’t think he was on hand, do you? "
MYCROFT," So ... (he pushes the wallet across the table towards John, then puts his elbows on the table, clasps his hands in front of him and rests his chin on them) ... what should we tell Sherlock? "
SHERLOCK, Clearly you’ve got news. 
SHERLOCK," If it’s about the Leeds triple murder, it was the gardener. Nobody noticed the earring. "
JOHN," Hi. Er, no, it’s, um ... (he takes a couple of steps into the kitchen) ... it’s about Irene Adler. "
SHERLOCK, Oh? Something happened? Has she come back? 
JOHN," No, she’s, er ... I just bumped into Mycroft downstairs. He had to take a call. "
JOHN," No. She’s, er ... "
JOHN, She’s in America. 
SHERLOCK, America? 
JOHN," Mmm-hmm. Got herself on a witness protection scheme, apparently. Dunno how she swung it, but, er, well, you know. "
SHERLOCK, I know what? 
JOHN," Well, you won’t be able to see her again. "
SHERLOCK, Why would I want to see her again? 
SHERLOCK, Is that her file? 
JOHN, Yes. I was just gonna take it back to Mycroft. 
JOHN, Do you want to ...? 
JOHN, Hmm. 
JOHN," Listen, actually ... "
SHERLOCK," Oh, but I will have the camera phone, though. "
JOHN, There’s nothing on it any more. It’s been stripped. 
SHERLOCK," I know, but I ... "
SHERLOCK, ... I’ll still have it. 
JOHN, I’ve gotta give this back to Mycroft. You can’t keep it. 
JOHN," Sherlock, I have to give this to Mycroft. It’s the government’s now. I couldn’t even give ... "
SHERLOCK, Please. 
SHERLOCK, Thank you. 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
JOHN," Did she ever text you again, after ... all that? "
SHERLOCK," Once, a few months ago. "
JOHN, What did she say? 
SHERLOCK," “Goodbye, Mr Holmes.” "
 They go on for a long time, 
Then comes the one reply he sent to her, 
And at the bottom of the list is her last message to him, 
 which reads, 
SHERLOCK, The Woman. 
SHERLOCK, The Woman. 
  GRACE," Oh, hello.  (Henry stops and looks at her, but his attention is mostly focused on her dog – some kind of spaniel which just stands there pretty much ignoring him.)  GRACE: Are you all right?  (Still Henry stares at the dog, whose features are mostly obscured in shadow due to the sun rising behind it.)  GRACE: What is it, dear? Are you lost?  (The dog pokes its nose towards him in a friendly way. Henry screams in utter terror.)   Twenty years later, the young boy’s screams are echoing in adult Henry’s ears. He looks around blankly as if he doesn’t know where he is or how he got there, then his face fills with horror when he realises that he is standing in the middle of a deep hollow in the woods. He starts to stumble away.   OPENING CREDITS.   BAKER STREET. The door to 221B slams closed on someone who has just gone inside, and the camera pans across to show two toy nodding dogs in the window of Speedy’s café. Upstairs in the flat, the living room door bursts open and Sherlock charges in, stopping just inside the room and slamming the end of a long pole down onto the ground. Sitting in his armchair, John looks round and his eyes widen at the sight of his flatmate, who is wearing black trousers and a white shirt and whose arms, face and shirt are covered with blood – far too much blood for it to be his own – and who is holding a harpoon. He looks round to John, breathing heavily.  SHERLOCK: Well, that was tedious.  JOHN: You went on the Tube like that?!  SHERLOCK (irritated): None of the cabs would take me.  (He turns and leaves the room.)   Later he is back in the room having cleaned himself up and changed into a clean shirt and trousers with one of his blue dressing gowns over the top. He is still carrying the harpoon and is pacing rapidly between the door and the window, looking round repeatedly at John who is sitting in his chair and flicking through the newspapers.  SHERLOCK (impatiently): Nothing?  JOHN: Military coup in Uganda.  SHERLOCK: Hmm.  (John chuckles in amusement when he sees something in one of the papers.)  JOHN: Another photo of you with the, er ...  (He points to a photograph of Sherlock wearing the deerstalker hat. Sherlock makes a disgusted noise and continues pacing. John moves on to another newspaper.)  JOHN: Oh, um, Cabinet reshuffle.  SHERLOCK (furious): Nothing of importance?  (He stops and slams the end of the harpoon onto the ground and roars with rage.)  SHERLOCK: Oh, God!  (He looks round at John intensely.)  SHERLOCK: John, I need some. Get me some.  JOHN (calmly): No.  SHERLOCK (intensely): Get me some.  JOHN (more loudly): No. (He points sternly at him.) Cold turkey, we agreed, no matter what.  (Irritated, Sherlock leans the harpoon against the dining table.)  JOHN: Anyway, you’ve paid everyone off, remember? No-one within a two mile radius’ll sell you any.  SHERLOCK: Stupid idea. Whose idea was that?  (John looks round at him and clears his throat pointedly. Sherlock looks towards the door.)  SHERLOCK (shouting): Mrs Hudson!  (He starts hurling paperwork off the table, desperately searching for what he needs.)  JOHN: Look, Sherlock, you’re doing really well. Don’t give up now.  SHERLOCK (frantically as he continues his search): Tell me where they are. Please. Tell me.  (As John remains silent, Sherlock straightens up and then turns his most appealing puppy-dog eyes on him, hesitating before he speaks and almost forming the word a couple of times before actually speaking it.)  SHERLOCK: Please.  [He begged for mercy! Twice!]  JOHN: Can’t help, sorry.  SHERLOCK: I’ll let you know next week’s lottery numbers.  (John chuckles.)  SHERLOCK (exasperated): Oh, it was worth a try.  (He looks around the room, then gets inspired and hurls himself to the floor in front of the fireplace. Unearthing a Persian slipper from the pile of papers in front of the unlit fire, he holds it up and scrabbles about inside as Mrs Hudson arrives at the door and comes in.)  MRS HUDSON: Ooh-ooh!  SHERLOCK (rummaging about in the fireplace and speaking almost sing-song): My secret supply. What have you done with my secret supply?  MRS HUDSON: Eh?  SHERLOCK: Cigarettes! What have you done with them? Where are they?  MRS HUDSON: You know you never let me touch your things!  (She looks around at the mess.)  MRS HUDSON: Ooh, chance would be a fine thing.  SHERLOCK (standing up and facing her): I thought you weren’t my housekeeper.  MRS HUDSON: I’m not.  (Making a frustrated noise, Sherlock stomps back over to the harpoon and picks it up again. Behind him, Mrs Hudson looks down at John who does the universal mime for offering someone a drink. She looks at Sherlock again.)  MRS HUDSON: How about a nice cuppa, and perhaps you could put away your harpoon.  SHERLOCK: I need something stronger than tea. Seven per cent stronger.  (He glares out of the window, then turns back towards Mrs Hudson and aims the point of the harpoon at her. She flinches.)  SHERLOCK: You’ve been to see Mr Chatterjee again.  MRS HUDSON: Pardon?  SHERLOCK (pointing with the harpoon’s tip): Sandwich shop. That’s a new dress, but there’s flour on the sleeve. You wouldn’t dress like that for baking.  JOHN: Sherlock ...  SHERLOCK: Thumbnail: tiny traces of foil. Been at the scratch cards again. We all know where that leads, don’t we?  (He sniffs deeply as he finally stops aiming the harpoon at her.)  SHERLOCK: Mmm: ‘Kasbah Nights.’ Pretty racy for first thing on a Monday morning, wouldn’t you agree? I’ve written a little blog on the identification of perfumes. It’s on the website – you should look it up.  MRS HUDSON (exasperated): Please.  SHERLOCK: I wouldn’t pin your hopes on that cruise with Mr Chatterjee. He’s got a wife in Doncaster (he adopts a south Yorkshire accent to say the town’s name) that nobody knows about.  JOHN (angrily): Sherlock!  SHERLOCK: Well, nobody except me.  MRS HUDSON (upset): I don’t know what you’re talking about, I really don’t.  (She storms out of the flat, slamming the living room door closed as she goes. Sherlock leaps over the back of his armchair from behind it, then perches on the seat, wrapping his arms around his knees like a petulant child. John slams his newspaper down.)  JOHN: What the bloody hell was all that about?  SHERLOCK (rocking back and forth): You don’t understand.  JOHN (sternly): Go after her and apologise.  SHERLOCK (staring at him): Apologise?  JOHN: Mm-hm.  SHERLOCK (sighing): Oh, John, I envy you so much.  (John hesitates, wondering whether to rise to the bait, but eventually asks.)  JOHN: You envy me?  SHERLOCK: Your mind: it’s so placid, straightforward, barely used. Mine’s like an engine, racing out of control; a rocket tearing itself to pieces trapped on the launch pad. (Loudly, frantically) I need a case!  JOHN (equally loudly): You’ve just solved one! By harpooning a dead pig, apparently!  (With an exasperated noise, Sherlock jumps up in the air and then lands in the seated position on the chair.)  SHERLOCK: That was this morning!  (He starts drumming the fingers of both hands on the arms of the chair while stomping his feet on the floor.)  SHERLOCK: When’s the next one?  JOHN: Nothing on the website?  (Sherlock gets up and walks over to the table, collects his laptop and hands it to John, who looks at the message on there while Sherlock stomps over to the window and narrates part of it.)  SHERLOCK: “Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes. I can’t find Bluebell anywhere. Please please please can you help?”  JOHN: Bluebell?  SHERLOCK (irritated): A rabbit, John!  JOHN: Oh.  SHERLOCK (sarcastically): Ah, but there’s more! Before Bluebell disappeared, it turned luminous ...  (He adopts a little girl’s voice for the next three words.)  SHERLOCK: ... “like a fairy” according to little Kirsty; then the next morning, Bluebell was gone! Hutch still locked, no sign of a forced entry ...  (He stops and his expression becomes more intense.)  SHERLOCK: Ah! What am I saying? This is brilliant! Phone Lestrade. Tell him there’s an escaped rabbit.  JOHN: Are you serious?  SHERLOCK: It’s this, or Cluedo.  JOHN: Ah, no!  (He closes the laptop and gets up to put it back on the table.)  JOHN: We are never playing that again!  SHERLOCK: Why not?  JOHN: Because it’s not actually possible for the victim to have done it, Sherlock, that’s why.  SHERLOCK: Well, it was the only possible solution.  JOHN (sitting down again): It’s not in the rules.  SHERLOCK (furiously): Then the rules are wrong!  (The doorbell rings. John thoughtfully holds up a finger as Sherlock looks towards the living room door.)  JOHN: Single ring.  SHERLOCK: Maximum pressure just under the half second.  JOHN and SHERLOCK (simultaneously): Client.   Not long afterwards, a recording of a documentary is playing on the TV. Sherlock has taken off the dressing gown and exchanged it for a jacket and is sitting in his chair. John has relocated to the dining table chair near Sherlock’s, and a man is sitting in John’s chair. The documentary footage shows scenes of Dartmoor. Sherlock instantly looks bored.  PRESENTER (voiceover): Dartmoor. It’s always been a place of myth and legend, but is there something else lurking out here – something very real?  (Footage of “Keep Out” signs.)  PRESENTER (walking along a narrow road): Because Dartmoor’s also home to one of the government’s most secret of operations ...  (Sherlock’s eyes flick repeatedly between the screen and the man in John’s chair as the footage shows a large sign saying:   AUTHORISED PERSONNEL ONLY  YOU ARE NOW ENTERING A RESTRICTED AREA  BASKERVILLE"
ve been persistent stories about the Baskerville experiments," genetic mutations, animals grown for the battlefield. There are many who believe that within this compound, in the heart of this ancient wilderness, there are horrors beyond imagining. But the real question is: are all of them still inside?  (The footage switches to an indoor scene where Henry is sitting in front of the camera talking to an offscreen interviewer. A caption at the bottom of the screen shows him as “Henry Knight, Grimpen resident”.)  HENRY: I was just a kid. It-it was on the moor.  (There’s a cut-away to a child’s drawing of a huge snarling dog with red eyes. The caption says, “Henry’s drawing (aged 9)”.)  HENRY (onscreen): It was dark, but I know what I saw. I know what killed my father.  (Sighing, Sherlock picks up the remote control and switches off the footage.)  SHERLOCK (to Henry): What did you see?  HENRY: Oh. (He points to the television.) I ... I was just about to say.  SHERLOCK: Yes, in a TV interview. I prefer to do my own editing.  HENRY: Yes. Sorry, yes, of course. ’Scuse me.  (He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a paper napkin and wipes his nose on it.)  JOHN: In your own time.  SHERLOCK: But quite quickly.  (Henry lowers the napkin.)  HENRY: Do you know Dartmoor, Mr Holmes?  SHERLOCK: No.  HENRY: It’s an amazing place. It’s like nowhere else. It’s sort of ... bleak but beautiful.  SHERLOCK: Mmm, not interested. Moving on.  HENRY: We used to go for walks, after my mum died, my dad and me. Every evening we’d go out onto the moor.  SHERLOCK: Yes, good. Skipping to the night that your dad was violently killed. Where did that happen?  (John’s eyes raise skywards at Sherlock’s insensitive attitude.)  HENRY: There’s a place – it’s... it’s a sort of local landmark called Dewer’s Hollow.  (He gazes at Sherlock who tilts his head at him as if to say, “And...?”)  HENRY: That’s an ancient name for the Devil.  SHERLOCK (quirking an eyebrow): So?  JOHN: Did you see the Devil that night?  (His face haunted with memories, Henry looks across to him and nods.)  HENRY (in a whisper): Yes.  (Flashback to Henry’s father screaming as he is pulled off his feet by something while young Henry watches in horror nearby.)  HENRY (voiceover): It was huge. Coal-black fur, with red eyes.  (In the flashback, Henry’s father finally falls silent. The creature growls savagely and young Henry turns and begins to scramble away.)  HENRY (tearfully): It got him, tore at him, tore him apart.  (Sherlock watches him intensely.)  HENRY: I can’t remember anything else. They found me the next morning, just wandering on the moor. My dad’s body was never found.  JOHN: Hmm. (He looks across to Sherlock.) Red eyes, coal-black fur, enormous: dog? Wolf?  SHERLOCK: Or a genetic experiment.  (He looks away, biting back a smile.)  HENRY: Are you laughing at me, Mr Holmes?  SHERLOCK: Why, are you joking?  HENRY: My dad was always going on about the things they were doing at Baskerville; about the type of monsters they were breeding there. People used to laugh at him. At least the TV people took me seriously.  SHERLOCK: And, I assume, did wonders for Devon tourism.  JOHN (uncomfortably): Yeah ...  (In an attempt to stop Sherlock’s continuing sarcasm, he leans forward to Henry. Sherlock rolls his eyes when he realises what John is doing.)  JOHN: Henry, whatever did happen to your father, it was twenty years ago. Why come to us now?  (Henry sits forward, staring at Sherlock.)  HENRY: I’m not sure you can help me, Mr Holmes, since you find it all so funny.  (He stands up and walks around the chair, heading towards the door.)  SHERLOCK: Because of what happened last night.  JOHN: Why, what happened last night?  (Henry turns back towards them.)  HENRY: How ... how do you know?  SHERLOCK: I didn’t know; I noticed.  (John shuffles on his chair with an “Oh dear lord, here we go” expression on his face.)  SHERLOCK (quick fire): You came up from Devon on the first available train this morning. You had a disappointing breakfast and a cup of black coffee. The girl in the seat across the aisle fancied you. Although you were initially keen, you’ve now changed your mind. You are, however, extremely anxious to have your first cigarette of the day. Sit down, Mr Knight, and do please smoke. I’d be delighted.  (Henry stares at him, then glances across to John who averts his gaze and sighs. Hesitantly, Henry walks back to the armchair and sits down, fishing in his jacket pocket.)  HENRY: How on earth did you notice all that?!  JOHN: It’s not important ...  (But Sherlock’s already off.)  SHERLOCK (looking at two small round white pieces of paper stuck to Henry’s coat): Punched-out holes where your ticket’s been checked ...  JOHN: Not now, Sherlock.  SHERLOCK: Oh please. I’ve been cooped up in here for ages.  JOHN: You’re just showing off.  SHERLOCK: Of course. I am a show-off. That’s what we do.  (He turns his attention back to Henry and the napkin that he’s still holding.)  SHERLOCK: The train napkin that you used to mop up the spilled coffee: the strength of the stain shows that you didn’t take milk. There are traces of ketchup on it and round your lips and on your sleeve. Cooked breakfast – or the nearest thing those trains can manage. Probably a sandwich.  (Henry half-sobs, over-awed.)  HENRY: How did you know it was disappointing?  SHERLOCK: Is there any other type of breakfast on a train? The girl – female handwriting’s quite distinctive. Wrote her phone number down on the napkin. I can tell from the angle she wrote at that she was sat across from you on the other side of the aisle. Later – after she got off, I imagine – you used the napkin to mop up your spilled coffee, accidentally smudging the numbers. You’ve been over the last four digits yourself with another pen, so you wanted to keep the number. Just now, though, you used the napkin to blow your nose. Maybe you’re not that into her after all. Then there’s the nicotine stains on your fingers ... your shaking fingers. I know the signs.  (His gaze becomes intense.)  SHERLOCK: No chance to smoke one on the train; no time to roll one before you got a cab here.  (He glances at his watch.)  SHERLOCK: It’s just after nine fifteen. You’re desperate. The first train from Exeter to London leaves at five forty-six a.m. You got the first one possible, so something important must have happened last night. Am I wrong?  (Henry stares at him in amazement, then draws in a shaky breath.)  HENRY: No.  (Sherlock smiles smugly. John takes a drink from his mug to hide his “oh bugger it” look.)  HENRY (awestruck): You’re right. You’re completely, exactly right. Bloody hell, I heard you were quick.  SHERLOCK: It’s my job.  (He leans forward in his seat and glares at Henry intensely.)  SHERLOCK: Now shut up and smoke.  (John frowns towards him. As Henry takes out a roll-up and lights it, John consults the notes he’s taken so far.)  JOHN: Um, Henry, your parents both died and you were, what, seven years old?  (Henry is concentrating on taking his first drag on his cigarette. As he exhales his first lungful, Sherlock stands up and steps closer to him.)  HENRY: I know. That ... my ...  (He stops as Sherlock leans into the smoke drifting up from the cigarette and from Henry’s mouth and breathes in deeply and noisily through his nose. Having sucked up most of the smoke, he sits down again and breathes out, whining quietly in pleasure.)  JOHN (trying hard to ignore him): That must be a ... quite a trauma. Have you ever thought that maybe you invented this story, this ...  (Henry has exhaled another lungful of smoke and Sherlock dives in to noisily hoover up the smoke again. John pauses patiently until he sits down again.)  JOHN: ... to account for it?  (Henry drags his eyes away from Sherlock.)  HENRY: That’s what Doctor Mortimer says.  JOHN: Who?  SHERLOCK: His therapist.  HENRY (almost simultaneously): My therapist.  SHERLOCK: Obviously.  HENRY: Louise Mortimer. She’s the reason I came back to Dartmoor. She thinks I have to face my demons.  SHERLOCK: And what happened when you went back to Dewer’s Hollow last night, Henry? You went there on the advice of your therapist and now you’re consulting a detective. What did you see that changed everything?  HENRY: It’s a strange place, the Hollow.  (He flashes back in his mind to when he was standing in the Hollow the previous evening.)  HENRY: Makes you feel so cold inside, so afraid.  SHERLOCK (rolling his eyes): Yes, if I wanted poetry I’d read John’s emails to his girlfriends. Much funnier.  (John sighs hard in an attempt to release the tension that might make him kill his flatmate.)  SHERLOCK (to Henry): What did you see?  HENRY: Footprints – on the exact spot where I saw my father torn apart.  (Looking exasperated, Sherlock leans back in his seat.)  JOHN: Man’s or a woman’s?  HENRY: Neither. They were ...  SHERLOCK (interrupting): Is that it? Nothing else. Footprints. Is that all?  HENRY: Yes, but they were ...  SHERLOCK (interrupting): No, sorry, Doctor Mortimer wins. Childhood trauma masked by an invented memory. Boring! Goodbye, Mr Knight. Thank you for smoking.  HENRY: No, but what about the footprints?  SHERLOCK: Oh, they’re probably paw prints; could be anything, therefore nothing.  (He leans forward in his seat and flicks his fingers at Henry, gesturing him towards the door.)  SHERLOCK: Off to Devon with you; have a cream tea on me.  (Standing up and buttoning his jacket, he heads into the kitchen. Henry turns in his seat to look at him.)  HENRY: Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!  (Sherlock stops dead in his tracks, then slowly turns and comes back to the kitchen doorway and stares down at Henry.)  SHERLOCK: Say that again.  HENRY: I found the footprints; they were ...  SHERLOCK: No, no, no, your exact words. Repeat your exact words from a moment ago, exactly as you said them.  (Henry thinks for a second, then slowly recites his words back to him.)  HENRY: Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic ... hound.  (Sherlock raises his head.)  SHERLOCK: I’ll take the case.  JOHN (startled): Sorry, what?  (Sherlock adopts the prayer position in front of his mouth and begins to pace slowly across the living room.)  SHERLOCK: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. It’s very promising.  JOHN: No-no-no, sorry, what? A minute ago, footprints were boring; now they’re very promising?  SHERLOCK (stopping): It’s nothing to do with footprints. As ever, John, you weren’t listening. Baskerville: ever heard of it?  JOHN: Vaguely. It’s very hush-hush.  SHERLOCK: Sounds like a good place to start.  HENRY: Ah! You’ll come down, then?  SHERLOCK: No, I can’t leave London at the moment. Far too busy. Don’t worry – putting my best man onto it.  (He walks over to John and pats his shoulder.)  SHERLOCK: Always rely on John to send me the relevant data, as he never understands a word of it himself.  JOHN: What are you talking about, you’re busy? You don’t have a case! A minute ago you were complaining ...  SHERLOCK (interrupting): Bluebell, John! I’ve got Bluebell! The case of the vanishing, glow-in-the-dark rabbit! (He looks at Henry.) NATO’s in uproar.  HENRY: Oh, sorry, no, you’re not coming, then?  (Putting on a regretful expression, Sherlock shakes his head sadly. John groans.)  JOHN: Okay. (He stands up while Sherlock smiles smugly.) Okay.  (He walks over to the mantelpiece and picks up the skull, taking a packet of cigarettes from underneath it. Putting down the skull again, he turns and tosses the packet across to Sherlock, who catches it and then instantly tosses it over his shoulder.)  SHERLOCK: I don’t need those any more. I’m going to Dartmoor.  (He walks out of the living room.)  SHERLOCK: You go on ahead, Henry. We’ll follow later.  HENRY (scrambling to his feet): Er, sorry, so you are coming?  (Sherlock turns and walks back into the room.)  SHERLOCK: Twenty year old disappearance; a monstrous hound? I wouldn’t miss this for the world!"
  MRS HUDSON," ... cruise together. You had no intention of taking me on it ...  (She throws something at the closed door. As it bounces heavily off the glass, John recoils.)  JOHN: Oh! Looks like Mrs Hudson finally got to the wife in Doncaster.  SHERLOCK: Mmm. Wait ’til she finds out about the one in Islamabad.  (John sniggers and gets into the taxi. Sherlock follows him in.)  SHERLOCK (to the driver): Paddington Station, please.   DARTMOOR. After many shots of the beautiful Devon scenery which your transcriber is delighted to sit back and watch while resting her aching fingers, we find our boys driving across the moors in a large black Land Rover jeep. Sherlock is driving ... and if they’re not playing “Yellow Car” I shall be most disappointed.  Some time later, away from the road, Sherlock is standing dramatically skylined on a large stone outcrop while John stands at the foot of it consulting a map. He points ahead of himself at a large array of buildings in the distance.  JOHN: There’s Baskerville.  (He turns and points behind them. Sherlock turns to look.)  JOHN: That’s Grimpen Village.  (He turns and looks ahead of them again, checking the map for the name of the heavily wooded area to the left of the Baskerville complex.)  JOHN: So that must be ... yeah, it’s Dewer’s Hollow.  (Sherlock points to an area in between the complex and the Hollow.)  SHERLOCK: What’s that?  JOHN: Hmm?  (He has binoculars on a strap around his neck and now he lifts them and looks more closely at the fencing and the warning signs.)  JOHN: Minefield? Technically Baskerville’s an army base, so I guess they’ve always been keen to keep people out.  SHERLOCK: Clearly.   Later, they drive into Grimpen Village and pull into the car park of the Cross Keys inn. They get out and walk towards the entrance of the pub, where a young man who is apparently a tour guide is talking to a group of tourists.  FLETCHER: ... three times a day, tell your friends. Tell anyone!  (The boys walk past the group and see that Fletcher is standing next to a large sign on which is painted a black image of a wolf-like creature with the words “BEWARE THE HOUND!!” above it.)  FLETCHER (to the tourists): Don’t be strangers, and remember ... stay away from the moor at night if you value your lives!  (Sherlock has been pulling his overcoat around him as he walks towards the pub, and now he pops the collar. John looks round at him pointedly.)  SHERLOCK (trying and failing to look nonchalant): I’m cold.  (The tourist group walks away from Fletcher. Once their backs are turned he puts on a large shaggy wolf’s-head mask. Sherlock and John walk into the pub, which has a blackboard outside advertising “Boutique Rooms & Vegetarian Cuisine.” Fletcher runs over to a couple of the nearby tourists and roars. They flinch and the woman shrieks in surprise.)   Flashback to Henry Knight’s father being grabbed by something in Dewer’s Hollow, and young Henry’s horrified face. In the present, adult Henry flinches, his eyes closed as he sits half reclined on a comfortable armchair. The flashbacks continue to haunt him until he opens his eyes and sighs. A woman is sitting a short distance away with a notebook and pen on her lap.  HENRY: That part doesn’t change.  MORTIMER: What does?  (Henry runs his hands over his face.)  HENRY: Oh, there’s something else. It-it’s a word.  (Sighing heavily in concentration, he closes his eyes again and sees the word as if it is stitched or knitted into some fabric.)  HENRY: “Liberty.”  (He opens his eyes again.)  MORTIMER: Liberty?  HENRY (closing his eyes again): There’s another word. (He concentrates and sees the next word stitched in the fabric.) “In.” I-N. “Liberty In.” (He looks at his therapist.) What do you think it means?  (She shakes her head. He sighs in frustration.)   CROSS KEYS INN. While Sherlock prowls around the interior of the pub, John is at the bar checking in. The manager and barman, Gary, hands him some keys.  GARY: Eh, sorry we couldn’t do a double room for you boys.  JOHN: That’s fine. We-we’re not ...  (He looks at the smug knowing smile on Gary’s face and gives up.)  JOHN (giving him some money for the drink he has just bought): There you go.  GARY: Oh, ta. I’ll just get your change.  JOHN: Ta.  (As Gary goes to the till, John’s glance falls on a pile of receipts and invoices which have been punched onto a spike on the bar. He frowns when he sees that one is labelled “Undershaw Meat Supplies.” Quickly he reaches out and rips it from the spike, putting it into his pocket as Gary comes back with his change.)  GARY: There you go.  JOHN: I couldn’t help noticing on the map of the moor: a skull and crossbones.  GARY: Oh that, aye.  JOHN: Pirates?!  GARY: Eh, no, no. The Great Grimpen Minefield, they call it.  JOHN: Oh, right.  GARY: It’s not what you think. It’s the Baskerville testing site. It’s been going for eighty-odd years. I’m not sure anyone really knows what’s there any more.  (Nearby, Sherlock is still prowling around and now seems to find something of interest at one of the tables.)  JOHN (to Gary): Explosives?  GARY: Oh, not just explosives. Break into that place and – if you’re lucky – you just get blown up, so they say ... in case you’re planning on a nice wee stroll.  (Sherlock loses interest in the table and wanders off again.)  JOHN: Ta. I’ll remember.  GARY: Aye. No, it buggers up tourism a bit, so thank God for the demon hound! (He chuckles, coming out from behind the bar presumably to clear some glasses.) Did you see that show, that documentary?  JOHN: Quite recently, yeah.  GARY: Aye. God bless Henry Knight and his monster from hell.  JOHN: Ever seen it – the hound?  GARY: Me? No.  (He points out the door past Sherlock, where Fletcher is just outside the pub and talking on his phone.)  GARY: Fletcher has. He runs the walks – the Monster Walks for the tourists, you know? He’s seen it.  JOHN: That’s handy for trade.  (Gary turns to a man who is clearly the inn’s cook who has just arrived behind the bar. Meanwhile Sherlock turns and follows Fletcher as he walks away from the doorway.)  GARY: I’m just saying we’ve been rushed off our feet, Billy.  BILLY: Yeah. Lots of monster-hunters. Doesn’t take much these days. One mention on Twitter and oomph.  (He looks at Gary.)  BILLY: We’re out of WKD.  [Transcriber’s note: WKD is a brand of alcopop aimed at the trendy young drinkers’ market.]  GARY: All right.  (He walks behind the bar again. Billy turns to John.)  BILLY: What with the monster and that ruddy prison, I don’t know how we sleep nights. Do you, Gary?  (Gary stops and puts a hand on his shoulder and looks at him affectionately.)  GARY: Like a baby.  BILLY: That’s not true. (He looks at John.) He’s a snorer.  GARY (embarrassed, trying to shut him up): Hey, wheesht!  BILLY (to John): Is yours a snorer?  JOHN: ... Got any crisps?"
  FLETCHER," Yeah ... No. All right? Right. Take care. ’Bye.  SHERLOCK: Mind if I join you?  (Fletcher shrugs and gestures to the table. Sherlock puts his pint down and sits on the bench on the other side of the table.)  SHERLOCK: It’s not true, is it? You haven’t actually seen this ... hound thing. (He grins in a friendly way.)  FLETCHER (looking at him suspiciously): You from the papers?  SHERLOCK: No, nothing like that. Just curious. Have you seen it?  FLETCHER: Maybe.  SHERLOCK: Got any proof?  FLETCHER: Why would I tell you if I did? ’Scuse me.  (He stands up to leave just as John comes over with his own drink.)  JOHN: I called Henry ...  SHERLOCK (talking over him): Bet’s off, John, sorry.  JOHN (sitting down): What?  FLETCHER: Bet?  SHERLOCK (looking at his watch): My plan needs darkness. (He looks up at the sky.) Reckon we’ve got another half an hour of light ...  FLETCHER: Wait, wait. What bet?  SHERLOCK: Oh, I bet John here fifty quid that you couldn’t prove you’d seen the hound.  JOHN (catching on immediately and looking at Fletcher): Yeah, the guys in the pub said you could.  (Fletcher smiles and points to Sherlock.)  FLETCHER: Well, you’re gonna lose your money, mate.  SHERLOCK: Yeah?  FLETCHER: Yeah. I’ve seen it. Only about a month ago, up at the Hollow. It was foggy, mind – couldn’t make much out.  SHERLOCK: I see. No witnesses, I suppose.  FLETCHER: No, but ...  SHERLOCK: Never are.  FLETCHER: Wait ...  (He has been working on his phone and now shows Sherlock a photograph.)  FLETCHER: There.  (Sherlock looks at the photograph which shows a dark-furred four-legged something in the distance but, with no scale amongst the surrounding vegetation, it’s impossible to tell the size – or even the species – of the animal. He snorts.)  SHERLOCK: Is that it? It’s not exactly proof, is it?  (Fletcher shows the photo to John.)  SHERLOCK: Sorry, John. I win.  (He picks up the stolen beer glass and makes as if to drink from it, although he never does.)  FLETCHER: Wait, wait. That’s not all. People don’t like going up there, you know – to the Hollow. Gives them a ... bad sort of feeling.  SHERLOCK: Ooh! Is it haunted?(!) Is that supposed to convince me?  (He puts down the glass again.)  FLETCHER: Nah, don’t be stupid, nothing like that, but I reckon there is something out there – something from Baskerville, escaped.  SHERLOCK (not really trying to hold back his sceptical snigger): A clone, a super-dog?(!)  FLETCHER: Maybe. God knows what they’ve been spraying on us all these years, or putting in the water. I wouldn’t trust ’em as far as I could spit.  SHERLOCK (nodding to the phone photograph): Is that the best you’ve got?  (Fletcher hesitates for a long moment but eventually he speaks reluctantly, lowering his voice.)  FLETCHER: I had a mate once who worked for the MOD. One weekend we were meant to go fishin’ but he never showed up – well, not ’til late. When he did, he was white as a sheet. I can see him now. “I’ve seen things today, Fletch,” he said, “that I never wanna see again. Terrible things.” He’d been sent to some secret Army place – Porton Down, maybe; maybe Baskerville, or somewhere else.  (He leans closer.)  FLETCHER: In the labs there – the really secret labs, he said he’d seen ... terrible things. Rats as big as dogs, he said, and dogs ...  (He reaches into his bag and pulls something out, showing it to the boys.)  FLETCHER: ... dogs the size of horses.  (He is holding a concrete cast of a dog’s paw print – but the print is at least six inches long from the tip of the claws to the back of the pad. Sherlock stares at it in surprise. John immediately pounces.)  JOHN: Er, we did say fifty?  (As Fletcher smiles triumphantly, Sherlock gets out his wallet and hands John a fifty pound note.)  JOHN: Ta.  (Sulkily, Sherlock gets up and walks away. John finishes his drink and follows him.)   Later, Sherlock and John take the car to Baskerville, Sherlock still driving. As they approach the complex, he observes that there are very many military personnel guarding the place, walking the perimeter etc. He drives up to the gates and a military security guard holding a rifle raises a hand. As Sherlock stops the jeep, the man walks around to the driver’s window.  SECURITY GUARD: Pass, please.  (Sherlock reaches into his coat pocket and hands him a pass.)  SECURITY GUARD: Thank you.  (He walks away with the pass. At the front of the vehicle, another security man encourages a sniffer dog to check the jeep, presumably for explosives.)  JOHN (quietly): You’ve got ID for Baskerville. How?  SHERLOCK (quietly): It’s not specific to this place. It’s my brother’s. Access all areas. I, um ... (he clears his throat) ... acquired it ages ago, just in case.  (The security guard swipes Sherlock’s pass through a reader at the gate room. The screen shows a fairly small photograph of Mycroft and names the card holder as Mycroft Holmes, giving him Unlimited Access and showing his security status as ‘Secure (No Threat)’.)  JOHN: Brilliant(!)  SHERLOCK: What’s the matter?  JOHN: We’ll get caught.  SHERLOCK: No we won’t – well, not just yet.  JOHN: Caught in five minutes. “Oh, hi, we just thought we’d come and have a wander round your top secret weapons base.” “Really? Great! Come in – kettle’s just boiled.” That’s if we don’t get shot.  (The gates begin to slide open as the security guard comes back over to the car.)  SECURITY DOG HANDLER: Clear.  SECURITY GUARD (handing Sherlock his pass): Thank you very much, sir.  SHERLOCK: Thank you.  (He puts the car in gear and eases the vehicle forward.)  SECURITY GUARD: Straight through, sir.  JOHN: Mycroft’s name literally opens doors!  SHERLOCK: I’ve told you – he practically is the British government. I reckon we’ve got about twenty minutes before they realise something’s wrong."
 LYONS," What is it? Are we in trouble? SHERLOCK (sternly): “Are we in trouble, sir?” LYONS: Yes, sir, sorry, sir. (Nevertheless, he steps in front of them and holds out his hands to prevent them getting nearer to the entrance.) SHERLOCK: You were expecting us? LYONS: Your ID showed up straight away, Mr Holmes. Corporal Lyons, security. Is there something wrong, sir? SHERLOCK: Well, I hope not, Corporal, I hope not. LYONS: It’s just we don’t get inspected here, you see, sir. It just doesn’t happen. JOHN: Ever heard of a spot check? (He takes a small wallet from his pocket and shows the ID inside to the corporal.) JOHN: Captain John Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. (Even before he finishes speaking, the corporal comes to attention and salutes. John crisply returns the salute. Fangirls faint.) LYONS: Sir. Major Barrymore won’t be pleased, sir. He’ll want to see you both. JOHN: I’m afraid we won’t have time for that. We’ll need the full tour right away. Carry on. (The corporal hesitates.) JOHN (instantly): That’s an order, Corporal. LYONS: Yes, sir. (He spins around and walks towards the entrance. Sherlock glances across to John with a proud smile on his face as they follow. At the entrance, which is marked “AUTOMATIC SECURITY DOOR,” Lyons swipes his pass through a reader, then waits for Sherlock to walk over and do the same with his own pass. The message “ACCESS GRANTED” appears on the reader. Lyons then presses a button and the locks on the door disengage. Sherlock checks his watch.  Elsewhere, probably a long way from Baskerville, a message flashes up on a screen:  CCV1 • security authorization requested • holmes, mycroft • priority ultra processing CCV1 • 5555*0000*x1 //5894  The security request begins to process. At Baskerville, the door swings open and Lyons leads the other two inside, taking off his beret as he goes. As he leads them towards the next security door, the boys talk quietly.) SHERLOCK: Nice touch. JOHN: Haven’t pulled rank in ages. SHERLOCK: Enjoy it? JOHN: Oh yeah. (Reaching the door, Lyons swipes his pass and then steps aside for Sherlock to do likewise. As he does so and another “ACCESS GRANTED” message appears, the authorisation request is sent out again. The doors slide opens and reveal an elevator on the other side. Lyons leads them inside and Sherlock looks at the wall panel. The lift, now on the ground floor, only goes downwards to five floors marked -1, -2, -3, -4 and B. Lyons presses the -1 button and the doors close, opening shortly afterwards on the next floor down. Lyons leads them out into a brightly lit and white tiled laboratory. As they walk forward, various scientific staff dressed either in white coveralls including full breathing masks, or in lab coats and face masks walk around the lab. There are large cages to the right of the elevator and as Lyons leads the way past them, a monkey screams and hurls itself at the bars towards them. Sherlock spins on his heel as he passes the cage, looking at the monkey and the chain around its neck.) SHERLOCK: How many animals do you keep down here? LYONS: Lots, sir. (At the far end of the lab, a scientist wearing coveralls and a breathing mask comes out of another room and takes off his mask. Another scientist walks across the lab with a beagle on a lead.) SHERLOCK: Any ever escape? LYONS: They’d have to know how to use that lift, sir. We’re not breeding them that clever. SHERLOCK: Unless they have help. (The man who just took off his mask comes over to the group.) FRANKLAND: Ah, and you are? LYONS: Sorry, Doctor Frankland. I’m just showing these gentlemen around. FRANKLAND (smiling at them): Ah, new faces, huh? Nice. Careful you don’t get stuck here, though. I only came to fix a tap! (John chuckles politely as Frankland walks towards the lift. John turns to Lyons.) JOHN: How far down does that lift go? LYONS: Quite a way, sir. JOHN: Mmm-hmm. And what’s down there? LYONS: Well, we have to keep the bins somewhere, sir. This way please, gentlemen. (Sherlock is watching Frankland as he reaches the elevator. Frankland in turn looks around to gaze with interest at the new arrivals. While Lyons leads John away, Sherlock walks backwards for a couple of paces before turning to follow.) JOHN: So what exactly is it that you do here? LYONS: I thought you’d know, sir, this being an inspection. (Sherlock is looking at the various scientists around the room, a couple looking at a rat in a glass cage, another one doing something to the leg of a monkey on a leash which is sitting on a metal table. Nearby, another scientist picks up what looks ominously like a glass container of serum.) JOHN: Well, I’m not an expert, am I? LYONS: Everything from stem cell research to trying to cure the common cold, sir. JOHN: But mostly weaponry? LYONS: Of one sort or another, yes. (He swipes his card through the reader of a door at the side of the lab, then steps aside for Sherlock to do likewise.) JOHN: Biological, chemical ...? LYONS: One war ends, another begins, sir. New enemies to fight. We have to be prepared. (As the door releases, Sherlock checks his watch. The security authorisation message goes out again, the message changing slightly:  CCV1 • security authorization //5894 • query • query • query CCV1 • 5555*0000*x1  Lyons leads them through the doors and into another lab where a monkey stands up on its back legs with one hand high in the air and shrieks before sitting down again on a high metal table. A female scientist looks at it and then turns to her colleague.) STAPLETON: Okay, Michael, let’s try Harlow Three next time. (As she walks away from the table, Lyons approaches her.) LYONS: Doctor Stapleton. SHERLOCK (thoughtfully): Stapleton. STAPLETON: Yes? (She looks at Sherlock and John.) Who’s this? LYONS: Priority Ultra, ma’am. Orders from on high. An inspection. STAPLETON: Really? SHERLOCK: We’re to be accorded every courtesy, Doctor Stapleton. What’s your role at Baskerville? (Stapleton looks at him and snorts with disbelieving laughter.) JOHN: Er, accorded every courtesy, isn’t that the idea? STAPLETON: I’m not free to say. Official secrets. SHERLOCK (smiling at her): Oh, you most certainly are free ... (his smile fades and his voice becomes ominous) ... and I suggest you remain that way. (She looks at him for a moment.) STAPLETON: I have a lot of fingers in a lot of pies. I like to mix things up – genes, mostly; now and again actual fingers. (Sherlock has had a lightbulb moment when she said the words ‘genes’ and is reaching into his pocket before she finishes the sentence.) SHERLOCK: Stapleton. I knew I knew your name. STAPLETON: I doubt it. SHERLOCK: People say there’s no such thing as coincidence. What dull lives they must lead. (He holds up his notebook to her on which he has written a single large word: “BLUEBELL”. She stares at it in amazement while Sherlock watches her face closely.) STAPLETON: Have you been talking to my daughter? SHERLOCK (putting his notebook away): Why did Bluebell have to die, Doctor Stapleton? JOHN (bewildered): The rabbit? SHERLOCK (to Stapleton, as she stares at him blankly): Disappeared from inside a locked hutch, which was always suggestive. JOHN: The rabbit? SHERLOCK: Clearly an inside job. STAPLETON: Oh, you reckon? SHERLOCK: Why? Because it glowed in the dark. (He loudly clicks the ‘k’ on the last word. Your transcriber giggles like an idiot.) STAPLETON: I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about. Who are you? (Even as she speaks Sherlock checks his watch again. Out in the security system somewhere, the authorisation request changes:  CCV1 • security authorization •• alert •• alert •• potential level 5 security breach 5555*0000*x1 //5894  Someone looking at the screen picks up a phone and lifts the handset to their ear. At Baskerville, Sherlock lowers his hand and turns to Lyons.) SHERLOCK: Well, I think we’ve seen enough for now, Corporal. Thank you so much. LYONS (surprised): That’s it? SHERLOCK: That’s it. (He turns and heads briskly back towards the door, John following behind and Lyons trailing after them.) It’s this way, isn’t it? STAPLETON (calling after them): Just a minute! (John catches up to his friend and speaks quietly so that Lyons can’t overhear him. His tone suggests that he is not best pleased.) JOHN: Did we just break into a military base to investigate a rabbit? (Sherlock reaches the door and swipes his card, then waits for Lyons to catch up to them and do the same with his own card. In Whitehall or somewhere similar, telephones begin to ring as a chain of calls relays the potential security breach and the message goes out:"
 He takes out his phone without stopping and reads the message,"  What are you doing? M  He laughs sarcastically.) SHERLOCK: Twenty-three minutes. Mycroft’s getting slow. (Reaching the lift doors, he swipes his card and Lyons does likewise. The doors open revealing Doctor Frankland standing inside as if he has been waiting in there. Trying to look nonchalant, he smiles at them.) FRANKLAND: Hello ... again. (Narrowing his eyes suspiciously, Sherlock walks into the lift with the others. Very shortly afterwards, one floor up, the doors open again and reveal a bearded man in military uniform waiting for them. He does not look happy.) LYONS: Er, um, Major ... BARRYMORE: This is bloody outrageous. Why wasn’t I told? JOHN: Major Barrymore, is it? (He steps out of the lift towards him.) Yes, well, good. Very good. (He offers him his hand to shake.) We’re very impressed, aren’t we, Mr Holmes? (Barrymore refuses to take John’s hand. Sherlock’s phone sounds another text alert and he reaches into his pocket for it again.) SHERLOCK: Deeply; hugely. (He walks past Barrymore as he looks at his text message which reads:  What’s going on Sherlock? M  The major follows along behind the boys while Sherlock hurries towards the exit door.) BARRYMORE: The whole point of Baskerville was to eliminate this kind of bureaucratic nonsense ... SHERLOCK: I’m so sorry, Major. BARRYMORE: Inspections?! SHERLOCK: New policy. Can’t remain unmonitored forever. Goodness knows what you’d get up to. (Urgently and quietly to John) Keep walking. (Lyons has briefly ducked into a side room but now hurries out again.) LYONS: Sir! (He slaps an alarm button on the wall. Alarms start to blare, red lights flash and the automated security door locks itself. The others turn back to him.) LYONS: ID unauthorised, sir. BARRYMORE: What? LYONS: I’ve just had the call. BARRYMORE: Is that right? (He turns to Sherlock and John.) BARRYMORE: Who are you? JOHN: Look, there’s obviously been some kind of mistake. (A little further back, Frankland is slowly walking towards the group, looking thoughtful. Barrymore holds out his hand for Sherlock’s ID card, which he gives to him. He looks at the card and then up at Sherlock.) BARRYMORE: Clearly not Mycroft Holmes. JOHN (getting out a notebook and starting to write): Computer error, Major. It’ll all have to go in the report. BARRYMORE: What the hell’s going on?! FRANKLAND: It’s all right, Major. I know exactly who these gentlemen are. BARRYMORE: You do? FRANKLAND: Yeah. I’m getting a little slow on faces but Mr Holmes here isn’t someone I expected to show up in this place. SHERLOCK: Ah, well ... FRANKLAND (offering him his hand to shake): Good to see you again, Mycroft. (John tries to mask his surprise. Smiling falsely, Sherlock shakes Frankland’s hand.) FRANKLAND: I had the honour of meeting Mr Holmes at the W.H.O. conference in ... (he pretends to think) ... Brussels, was it? SHERLOCK: Vienna. FRANKLAND: Vienna, that’s it. (He looks at Barrymore.) FRANKLAND: This is Mr Mycroft Holmes, Major. There’s obviously been a mistake. (Barrymore turns and nods to Lyons, who goes back to the alarm switch and turns it off. The lights stop flashing and the alarm falls silent. A moment later the entrance door’s lock disengages noisily.) BARRYMORE (turning back to Frankland): On your head be it, Doctor Frankland. FRANKLAND (laughing as he looks at the approaching Corporal Lyons): I’ll show them out, Corporal. LYONS: Very well, sir. (Sherlock spins on his heel and walks towards the now open entrance door. John and Frankland follow him while Barrymore glares after them unhappily. The boys go outside, John grimacing anxiously with an “Oh gods, I really hope we’re going to get away with this!” expression on his face. Frankland trots after them.) SHERLOCK: Thank you. FRANKLAND: This is about Henry Knight, isn’t it? (They don’t answer him but he takes their silence as agreement.) FRANKLAND: I thought so. I knew he wanted help but I didn’t realise he was going to contact Sherlock Holmes! (Sherlock grimaces.) FRANKLAND: Oh, don’t worry. I know who you really are. I’m never off your website. Thought you’d be wearing the hat, though. SHERLOCK: That wasn’t my hat. FRANKLAND (to John): I hardly recognise him without the hat! (John tries unsuccessfully to bite back a smile.) SHERLOCK (tetchily, sounding the ‘t’s loudly): It wasn’t my hat. FRANKLAND: I love the blog too, Doctor Watson. JOHN: Oh, cheers! FRANKLAND: The, er, the Pink thing ... JOHN: Mm-hm. FRANKLAND: ... and that one about the aluminium crutch! JOHN: Yes. SHERLOCK (stopping and turning back to Frankland): You know Henry Knight? FRANKLAND: Well, I knew his dad better. He had all sorts of mad theories about this place. Still, he was a good friend. (He looks back the way they came and sees that Major Barrymore is standing some distance away and watching them. He turns back to Sherlock.) FRANKLAND: Listen, I can’t really talk now. (He takes a card from his coat pocket and hands it over.) FRANKLAND: Here’s my, er, cell number. If I could help with Henry, give me a call. SHERLOCK: I never did ask, Doctor Frankland. What exactly is it that you do here? FRANKLAND: Oh, Mr Holmes, I would love to tell you – but then, of course, I’d have to kill you! (He laughs cheerfully.) SHERLOCK (straight faced): That would be tremendously ambitious of you. (Frankland’s smile fades and he shrugs in embarrassment.) SHERLOCK: Tell me about Doctor Stapleton. FRANKLAND: Never speak ill of a colleague. SHERLOCK: Yet you’d speak well of one, which you’re clearly omitting to do. FRANKLAND: I do seem to be, don’t I? (He shrugs.) SHERLOCK (raising the card that Frankland just gave him): I’ll be in touch. FRANKLAND: Any time. (The boys walk away from him and head towards their Land Rover.) JOHN: So? SHERLOCK: So? JOHN: What was all that about the rabbit? (Smiling briefly, Sherlock pulls his coat tighter around himself, flipping up the collar just as they reach the car. John rolls his eyes and turns to him.) JOHN: Oh, please, can we not do this, this time? SHERLOCK: Do what? JOHN: You being all mysterious with your cheekbones and turning your coat collar up so you look cool. (As he turns to go to the car door, Sherlock opens his mouth to speak but is apparently so disconcerted that for a moment he can’t find the words.) SHERLOCK: ... I don’t do that. JOHN: Yeah you do. (They get into the car.)  Later, Sherlock is driving them across the moors. JOHN: So, the email from Kirsty – the, er, missing luminous rabbit. SHERLOCK: Kirsty Stapleton, whose mother specialises in genetic manipulation. JOHN: She made her daughter’s rabbit glow in the dark. SHERLOCK: Probably a fluorescent gene removed and spliced into the specimen. Simple enough these days. JOHN: So ... (He looks across to Sherlock and waits for him to continue the sentence.) SHERLOCK: So we know that Doctor Stapleton performs secret genetic experiments on animals. The question is: has she been working on something deadlier than a rabbit? JOHN: To be fair, that is quite a wide field. (Sherlock looks round at John in startled surprise as if realising that that’s true.)"
 HENRY," Hi. JOHN: Hi. HENRY: Come in, come in. (Wiping his feet on the doormat, Sherlock walks in and heads down the hallway. John follows more slowly, stopping to look into a large high-ceilinged sitting room before following Henry again.) JOHN: This is, uh ... Are you, um ... (He searches for the right word for a moment before finding it.) JOHN: ... rich? HENRY: Yeah. JOHN: Right. (Henry leads off again. Sherlock throws a dark look at John before following him.)  Not long afterwards, in the kitchen in the glass extension, Sherlock spoons two sugar lumps into his mug and stirs them in. He is sitting on a stool at the central island and John is sitting next to him. Henry is standing at the side of the island gazing down at the work surface. HENRY: It’s-it’s a couple of words. It’s what I keep seeing. “Liberty” ... JOHN (reaching into his pocket for his notebook): Liberty. HENRY (looking up to him): “Liberty” and ... “in.” It’s just that. (He picks up the bottle of milk that’s on the island.) HENRY: Are you finished? JOHN: Mm. (Henry turns around to put the milk into the fridge. John looks at Sherlock.) JOHN: Mean anything to you? SHERLOCK (softly): “Liberty in death” – isn’t that the expression? The only true freedom. (John nods in agreement as Henry turns back around, sighing. Sherlock takes a drink from his mug.) HENRY: What now, then? JOHN: Sherlock’s got a plan. SHERLOCK: Yes. HENRY: Right. SHERLOCK: We take you back out onto the moor ... HENRY (nervously): Okay ... SHERLOCK: ... and see if anything attacks you. JOHN: What?! SHERLOCK: That should bring things to a head. HENRY: At night? You want me to go out there at night? SHERLOCK: Mm. JOHN: That’s your plan? (He snorts laughter.) Brilliant(!) SHERLOCK: Got any better ideas? JOHN: That’s not a plan. SHERLOCK: Listen, if there is a monster out there, John, there’s only one thing to do: find out where it lives. (He looks round to Henry and smiles widely at him before taking another drink from his mug. Henry does not look encouraged by this.)  DUSK. THE MOORS. As night begins to fall, Henry leads Sherlock and John across the rocks towards Dewer’s Hollow. All three of them have flashlights to light the uneven ground below their feet. Foxes scream repeatedly in the distance. By the time they reach the woods it is almost full dark and it becomes even darker when they head into the trees. John, bringing up the rear, hears rustling to his right and turns around to look. The other two don’t notice and continue onwards while John walks cautiously towards the sound he heard. He shines his torch into the bushes as an owl shrieks overhead, but he can see nothing. Raising his head he sees a light repeatedly winking on and off at the top of a hillside a fair distance away. He looks around to alert his friend. JOHN: Sher... (It’s only then that he realises that the other two have disappeared out of sight. He shines his flashlight in the direction they went but there’s no sign of them. He looks back to the light on the hillside, which is still intermittently flashing, and gets his notebook out of his pocket because he has recognised that the flashes are Morse code. He starts to write down the letters while speaking them aloud.) JOHN (softly): U ... M ... Q ... R ... A. (The light stops flashing. John looks down at his notebook.) JOHN (in a whisper): U, M, Q, R, A. (He tries it as a word.) Umqra? (Shaking his head, he looks up to the hillside again but no more light comes from it. Shutting the notebook, he heads off in the direction of the other two.) JOHN (whispering): Sherlock ... (Henry and Sherlock are a long way ahead and Henry’s torch shows that they’re at the edge of the minefield with its fencing and warning signs. They make their way along the edge of the fencing while John trails a long way behind them, still whispering his friend’s name repeatedly.) JOHN: Sherlock ... Sherlock ... (Up ahead, Sherlock breaks the silence.) SHERLOCK: Met a friend of yours. HENRY: What? SHERLOCK: Doctor Frankland. HENRY: Oh, right. Bob, yeah. SHERLOCK: Seems pretty concerned about you. HENRY: He’s a worrier, bless him. He’s been very kind to me since I came back. SHERLOCK: He knew your father. HENRY: Yeah. SHERLOCK: But he works at Baskerville. Didn’t your dad have a problem with that? HENRY: Well, mates are mates, aren’t they? I mean, look at you and John. SHERLOCK: What about us? HENRY: Well, I mean, he’s a pretty straightforward bloke, and you ... (Glancing back at Sherlock’s grim expression, he decides not to follow that line.) HENRY: They agreed never to talk about work, Uncle Bob and my dad. (He stops and turns to his left. As Sherlock stops and looks at him, Henry nods in the direction he’s looking.) HENRY (unhappily): Dewer’s Hollow. (Sherlock turns and looks at the steep drop in the land that leads down into a misty dark valley.) (Some distance behind them, John is still following their trail.) JOHN (whispering): Sherlock ... (As he progresses onwards, he hears an eerie metallic thrumming sound. He stops and aims his flashlight in the direction of the sound, then goes to move onwards just as the thrum sounds again. The sound continues to repeat, now interspersed with short metallic pings. John walks slowly towards the sound, then quietly chuckles when he sees a rusty metal container, possibly an oil drum, which is lying in the undergrowth. Water is dripping from the tree above it and causing the thrums and pings as it strikes the drum. Just as John looks at it and sighs with relief, something massive flashes past behind him. John spins and looks but it’s already gone, but a couple of seconds later an anguished animalistic howl sounds in the distance. John turns and begins to hurry to find the others.) (Sherlock is heading down into the Hollow, being careful to keep his balance on the steep slippery ground. Henry follows him down more slowly. Sherlock reaches the bottom and shines his torch around, finding giant paw prints all around the area. Some distance away, John is now running to get to the others. Another long anguished howl rings out. Still halfway down the slope, Henry pauses. Sherlock shines his torch up in the direction of the sound ... and his face begins to fill with horror at the sight which greets him. Unfortunately for the viewers, we can’t see what he is looking at, but whatever it is growls savagely from the top of the Hollow. As the beam from Sherlock’s flashlight flails along the Hollow’s rim, the whatever-it-is has already retreated. Sherlock recoils, his face confused and bewildered as he tries to take in what he just saw. From his position some distance away, Henry hurries down to join him.) HENRY: Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Did you see it? (Sherlock lowers his head, still unable to get his mind to accept the evidence of his eyes. He stares around, shaking his head, then shoves Henry out of his way and hurries back up the hillside. Henry follows him. Very shortly afterwards, John finally meets up with the other two making their way back.) JOHN (referring to the howling): Did you hear that? (Sherlock storms straight past him. John turns and follows.) HENRY: We saw it. We saw it. SHERLOCK: No. I didn’t see anything. HENRY (chasing after him): What? What are you talking about? SHERLOCK: I didn’t. See. Anything. (He hurries onwards with Henry and John trailing along behind him.)"
 HENRY," Look, he must have seen it. I saw it – he must have. He must have. I can’t ... Why? Why? (He stops in the doorway of the sitting room, turning back to John in anguish.) HENRY: Why would he say that? It-it-it-it-it was there. It was. (Taking off his gloves, John ushers him across to the sofa.) JOHN: Henry, Henry, I need you to sit down, try and relax, please. HENRY (sitting on the sofa): I’m okay, I’m okay. JOHN: Listen, I’m gonna give you something to help you sleep, all right? (He looks around the room and sees a bottle of water on a bureau nearby. He goes over to get it, while Henry unwraps his scarf from his neck, smiling.) HENRY: This is good news, John. It’s-it’s-it’s good. I’m not crazy. There is a hound; there ... there is. And Sherlock – he saw it too. No matter what he said, he saw it.  Later, Sherlock is back at the inn. Sitting in an armchair by a roaring open fire, his face is still full of shock and disbelief. Unaware of his distress, other patrons sit at nearby tables having their evening meal. John comes in and sits down in the armchair on the other side of the fire. JOHN: Well, he is in a pretty bad way. He’s manic, totally convinced there’s some mutant super-dog roaming the moors. (With his hands in the prayer position in front of his mouth, Sherlock glances nervously at John for a moment, then continues to gaze in the direction of the fire, lost in thought.) JOHN: And there isn’t, though, is there? ’Cause if people knew how to make a mutant super-dog, we’d know. (Sherlock clasps his fingers together, closing his eyes and breathing heavily as if trying to fend off a panic attack.) JOHN: They’d be for sale. I mean, that’s how it works. (He remembers something and reaches for his notebook.) JOHN: Er, listen: er, on the moor I saw someone signalling. Er, Morse – I guess it’s Morse. (Sherlock blinks rapidly and repeatedly.) JOHN (looking at his notes): Doesn’t seem to make much sense. (Sherlock pulls in a sharp breath through his nose and then blows the breath out again through his mouth.) JOHN: Er, U, M, Q, R, A. Does that mean ... anything ... (He finally realises how distressed his colleague is looking and pauses for a moment. He puts his notebook away and sits back in his chair.) JOHN: So, okay, what have we got? We know there’s footprints, ’cause Henry found them; so did the tour guide bloke. We all heard something. (Sherlock blows out another shaky breath. John looks across to him and frowns momentarily.) JOHN: Maybe we should just look for whoever’s got a big dog. SHERLOCK: Henry’s right. JOHN: What? SHERLOCK (his voice shaking): I saw it too. JOHN (shocked): What? SHERLOCK: I saw it too, John. JOHN: Just ... just a minute. (He sits forward.) You saw what? (Sherlock finally meets his gaze but his face is twisted with self-loathing as he forces himself to admit the truth.) SHERLOCK: A hound, out there in the Hollow. (He talks through gritted teeth.) A gigantic hound. (John almost laughs as Sherlock looks away, trying unsuccessfully to blink back tears. John sits back in his chair again, not quite able to cope with this strange reaction from his friend.) JOHN: Um, look, Sherlock, we have to be rational about this, okay? Now you, of all people, can’t just ... (Sherlock blows out another breath.) JOHN: Let’s just stick to what we know, yes? Stick to the facts. (Sherlock looks round at him.) SHERLOCK (softly): Once you’ve ruled out the impossible, whatever remains – however improbable – must be true. JOHN: What does that mean? (Looking away again, Sherlock reaches down and picks up a drink from a nearby table. Looking down at his trembling hand, he sniggers.) SHERLOCK: Look at me. I’m afraid, John. Afraid. (He takes a drink and then holds up the glass again, his hand still shaking.) JOHN: Sherlock? SHERLOCK: Always been able to keep myself distant ... (he takes another drink from the glass) ... divorce myself from ... feelings. But look, you see ... (He holds up the glass and glares at his shaking hand.) SHERLOCK: ... body’s betraying me. Interesting, yes? Emotions. (He slams the glass down onto the table.) The grit on the lens, the fly in the ointment. JOHN: Yeah, all right, Spock, just ... (Realising that he is starting to raise his voice, he looks around at the other people in the restaurant behind him and then looks back to Sherlock.) JOHN (more softly): ... take it easy. (Sherlock is blowing out a few more breaths and still failing to bring himself under control. He glances panic-stricken at John.) JOHN: You’ve been pretty wired lately, you know you have. I think you’ve just gone out there and got yourself a bit worked up. SHERLOCK: Worked ... up? JOHN: It was dark and scary ... SHERLOCK (laughing sarcastically): Me?! There’s nothing wrong with me. (He looks away, almost beginning to hyperventilate, then puts his fingertips to his temples, groaning in anguish. John looks at him in concern.) JOHN: Sherlock ... (Sherlock begins blowing out breaths again, his fingers trembling against his skin.) JOHN: Sher... SHERLOCK (loudly, furiously): THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME! (He glares round at John.) SHERLOCK: DO YOU UNDERSTAND? (He looks round at the other patrons, all of whom are now staring at him. He looks away again, then looks at John.) SHERLOCK: You want me to prove it, yes? (He pulls in a deep breath, trying to get himself under control.) SHERLOCK: We’re looking for a dog, yes, a great big dog, that’s your brilliant theory. Cherchez le chien. Good, excellent, yes, where shall we start? (The patrons have gone back to their eating. Sherlock looks over his shoulder and points towards a man and woman sitting opposite each other at a table in the corner of the restaurant. His voice becomes savage and relentless as he goes into deduction mode.) SHERLOCK: How about them? The sentimental widow and her son, the unemployed fisherman. The answer’s yes. JOHN: Yes? SHERLOCK: She’s got a West Highland terrier called Whisky. Not exactly what we’re looking for. JOHN (quietly): Oh, Sherlock, for God’s sake ... (Sherlock looks briefly across at the man and his jumper with reindeer and holly leaves knitted into it before turning away again.) SHERLOCK (quick fire): Look at the jumper he’s wearing. Hardly worn. Clearly he’s uncomfortable in it. Maybe it’s because of the material; more likely the hideous pattern, suggesting it’s a present, probably Christmas. So he wants into his mother’s good books. Why? Almost certainly money. (He takes another quick glance at the man.) SHERLOCK (quick fire): He’s treating her to a meal but his own portion is small. That means he wants to impress her, but he’s trying to economise on his own food. JOHN: Well, maybe he’s just not hungry. SHERLOCK (quick fire, becoming almost frenetic): No, small plate. Starter. He’s practically licked it clean. She’s nearly finished her pavlova. If she’d treated him, he’d have had as much as he wanted. He’s hungry all right, and not well-off – you can tell that by the state of his cuffs and shoes. (He asks the question he’s expecting to come from John at any moment.) SHERLOCK: “How d’you know she’s his mother?” (John, who until now has been looking at his colleague with concern as Sherlock’s voice – while lowered – has become increasingly intense, smiles briefly.) SHERLOCK (quick fire): Who else would give him a Christmas present like that? Well, it could be an aunt or an elder sister, but mother’s more likely. Now, he was a fisherman. Scarring pattern on his hands, very distinctive – fish hooks. They’re all quite old now, which suggests he’s been unemployed for some time. Not much industry in this part of the world, so he’s turned to his widowed mother for help. “Widowed?” Yes, obviously. She’s got a man’s wedding ring on a chain round her neck – clearly her late husband’s and too big for her finger. She’s well-dressed but her jewellery’s cheap. She could afford better, but she’s kept it – it’s sentimental. Now, the dog ... (he looks at the thick wiry hairs on the lower part of the woman’s black trousers) ... tiny little hairs all over the leg from where it gets a little bit too friendly, but no hairs above the knees, suggesting it’s a small dog, probably a terrier. In fact it is – a West Highland terrier called Whisky. “How the hell do you know that, Sherlock?” ’Cause she was on the same train as us and I heard her calling its name and that’s not cheating, that’s listening. I use my senses, John, unlike some people, so you see, I am fine, in fact I’ve never been better, so just Leave. Me. Alone. (He glares at John, who stares back at him in shock.) JOHN: Yeah. (He clears his throat.) JOHN: Okay. Okay. (Distressed by his colleague’s venom, he tries to settle back in his chair while Sherlock stares towards the fire, breathing heavily.) JOHN: And why would you listen to me? I’m just your friend. SHERLOCK (savagely): I don’t have friends. JOHN (softly): Naah. Wonder why? (He gets up and walks away.)"
s VOICE," Oh! Mr Selden! You’ve done it again! MAN’s VOICE: Oh, I keep catching it with my belt. (As the inhabitants of the car groan and continue about their ... ahem, business, John lowers his torch.) JOHN: Oh, God. (He hesitates and squints at the car, half-raising his torch again as if almost tempted to take another look, but then it fully hits him that the Morse messages he wrote down were nothing more than the random flashings of a car’s headlights during the sexual goings-on of a dogging site. He turns and heads back towards the pub.) JOHN: Sh... (As he walks away from the hillside his phone trills a text alert. He gets out the phone and looks at the message:  Henry’s therapist currently in Cross Keys Pub S  John writes a brief reply in capital letters, speaking it aloud as he types.) JOHN: So? (The reply comes almost instantly:  Interview her?  John answers:  WHY SHOULD I?  After a moment he gets another alert:  Downloading image ...  Shortly afterwards the image arrives and he opens it. It’s a covertly-taken photograph of Louise Mortimer standing at the bar. She’s pretty, and around John’s age. He looks at the photo for a moment and then walks on.) JOHN: Ooh, you’re a bad man. (It’s not clear, however, whether he’s talking to himself or to Sherlock.)"
  JOHN," Um, more wine, Doctor?  MORTIMER: Are you trying to get me drunk, Doctor?  JOHN: The thought never occurred! (He refills her glass.)  MORTIMER: Because a while ago I thought you were chatting me up.  JOHN (refilling his own glass): Ooh! Where did I go wrong?  MORTIMER: When you started asking me about my patients.  JOHN: Well, you see, I am one of Henry’s oldest friends.  MORTIMER: Yeah, and he’s one of my patients, so I can’t talk about him.  JOHN: Mm.  MORTIMER: Although he has told me about all his oldest friends. (She looks at him thoughtfully.) Which one are you?  JOHN (hopefully): A new one?  (She scoffs.)  JOHN: Okay, what about his father? He wasn’t one of your patients. Wasn’t he some sort of conspiracy nutter ... (he quickly corrects himself) ... theorist?  MORTIMER: You’re only a nutter if you’re wrong.  JOHN: Mm. And was he wrong?  MORTIMER: I should think so!  JOHN: But he got fixated on Baskerville, didn’t he? With what they were doing in there ... Couldn’t Henry have gone the same way, started imagining a hound?  (Louise looks at him pointedly.)  MORTIMER: Why d’you think I’m going to talk about this?!  JOHN (laughing in acknowledgement of her seeing through him): Because I think you’re worried about him, and because I’m a doctor too ...  (His face becomes more serious.)  JOHN: ... and because I have another friend who might be having the same problem.  (They lock eyes for a long moment and finally Louise sighs. She has apparently decided to tell him more than she really ought to ... but before she can even begin a hand claps down onto John’s shoulder from behind him. John looks round and sees Bob Frankland grinning down at him.)  FRANKLAND: Doctor Watson!  JOHN (unhappily): Hi.  FRANKLAND (to Louise): Hello. (To John) How’s the investigation going?  JOHN (doing everything but roll his eyes in dismay): Hello.  MORTIMER: What? Investigation?  FRANKLAND: Didn’t you know? Don’t you read the blog? Sherlock Holmes!  JOHN: It’s ...  MORTIMER: Sherlock who?  JOHN: No, it’s ...  FRANKLAND: Private detective! (He claps John on the shoulder again.) This is his PA!  JOHN: PA?  FRANKLAND: Well, live-in PA.  JOHN: Perfect(!)  MORTIMER: Live-in.  JOHN: This is Doctor Mortimer, Henry’s therapist.  FRANKLAND: Oh, hello. (He shakes hands with her.) Bob Frankland.  (He turns back to John. As he speaks, Louise is already twisting on her chair to take her coat off the back.)  FRANKLAND: Listen, tell Sherlock I’ve been keeping an eye on Stapleton. Any time he wants a little chat ... right?  JOHN: Mm.  (Frankland laughs heartily, claps John on the shoulder yet again and then walks away. John looks at Louise and realises that she has got her coat in her hands.)  JOHN: Oh.  MORTIMER: Why don’t you buy him a drink? I think he likes you.  (She stands up and leaves. John sighs.)   DAY TIME. THE MOORS. Sherlock is back on the stony outcrop again, staring towards Baskerville. His eyes flick between the complex and Dewer’s Hollow, then he turns and looks back towards Grimpen Village."
  SHERLOCK," Morning!  (He seems about to head for the kitchen but suddenly turns around and clasps Henry by the shoulders.)  SHERLOCK: Oh, how are you feeling?  (Henry looks terrible. Sherlock ducks his head down to get a better look into his face.)  HENRY (exhaustedly): I’m ... I didn’t sleep very well.  SHERLOCK: That’s a shame. Shall I make you some coffee? (He looks up at the ceiling above the door and points.) Oh look, you’ve got damp!  (He grins falsely at him until Henry turns his head to look at the ceiling, then drops the smile and turns and walks away towards the kitchen. Hurrying over to the cupboards, he starts opening and closing each one rapidly. Finally he finds the metal jar that he’s looking for and takes it out, rummaging inside it while he elbows the cupboard door closed. Tucking something from the jar inside his coat, he goes over to the sink and picks up a couple of mugs, taking them over to the central island just as Henry tiredly wanders in.)  HENRY: Listen ... last night.  (Sherlock gives him that horrifying attempt at a friendly smile while he takes the top off the coffee tin.)  HENRY: Why did you say you hadn’t seen anything? I mean, I only saw the hound for a minute, but...  (Sherlock has been dumping spoonfuls of coffee into the mugs without even looking, his eyes locked on Henry’s, and now he slams the coffee tin down onto the surface and steps closer to him, his eyes back to their normal intensity.)  SHERLOCK: Hound.  HENRY: What?  SHERLOCK: Why do you call it a hound? Why a hound?  HENRY: Why – what do you mean?  SHERLOCK: It’s odd, isn’t it? Strange choice of words – archaic. It’s why I took the case. “Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.” Why say “hound”?  HENRY: I don’t know! I ...  SHERLOCK: Actually, I’d better skip the coffee.  (He flares out of the kitchen. Henry sighs wearily.)   Later, Sherlock is walking back through the village but stops when he sees John in the church graveyard, sitting on the steps of a war memorial and looking through the notes in his notebook. Sherlock goes through the kissing gate [shut up, my imagination ...] and walks along the path towards John, who looks up as he hears him approach. John’s expression becomes uncomfortable as he tucks his notebook into his pocket. Grimacing briefly, Sherlock stops in front of him, also looking awkward.  SHERLOCK: Did you, er, get anywhere with that Morse code?  JOHN (stepping down): No.  (He starts to walk away.)  SHERLOCK: U, M, Q, R, A, wasn’t it?  (John keeps walking and Sherlock follows along behind him. He voices the initials as a word.)  SHERLOCK: UMQRA.  JOHN: Nothing.  (In Sherlock’s mind, he puts full stops in between the letters but still voices it as a word.)  SHERLOCK: U.M.Q...  JOHN: Look, forget it. It’s ... I thought I was on to something. I wasn’t.  SHERLOCK: Sure?  JOHN: Yeah.  SHERLOCK: How about Louise Mortimer? Did you get anywhere with her?  JOHN: No.  SHERLOCK: Too bad. Did you get any information?  (John smiles briefly and glances over his shoulder but still keeps walking.)  JOHN: You being funny now?  SHERLOCK: Thought it might break the ice a bit.  JOHN: Funny doesn’t suit you. I’d stick to ice.  (Sherlock looks at John’s retreating back, his face full of pain.)  SHERLOCK: John ...  JOHN: It’s fine.  SHERLOCK: No, wait. What happened last night ... Something happened to me; something I’ve not really experienced before ...  JOHN: Yes, you said: fear. Sherlock Holmes got scared. You said.  (Sherlock catches him up, takes hold of his arm and pulls him round to face him.)  SHERLOCK: No-no-no, it was more than that, John. It was doubt. I felt doubt. I’ve always been able to trust my senses, the evidence of my own eyes, until last night.  JOHN: You can’t actually believe that you saw some kind of monster.  SHERLOCK: No, I can’t believe that. (He grins bitterly for a moment.) But I did see it, so the question is: how? How?  JOHN: Yes. Yeah, right, good. So you’ve got something to go on, then? Good luck with that.  (He turns and starts to walk away again. Sherlock turns and calls after him.)  SHERLOCK: Listen, what I said before, John. I meant it.  (John stops and turns back to face him.)  SHERLOCK: I don’t have friends.  (He bites his lip briefly.)  SHERLOCK: I’ve just got one.  (John looks away as he takes in that statement for a moment, then he nods briefly and glances back at Sherlock.)  JOHN: Right.  (He turns and walks away again. Sherlock looks down, then instantly raises his head again and his eyes begin to flicker in realisation of something.)  SHERLOCK: John? John!  (He starts to chase after him.)  SHERLOCK: You are amazing! You are fantastic!  JOHN (not stopping): Yes, all right! You don’t have to overdo it.  SHERLOCK (catching up and overtaking him, then walking backwards in front of him): You’ve never been the most luminous of people, but as a conductor of light you are unbeatable.  JOHN: Cheers. ... What?  (Sherlock turns round and walks beside him, taking out his own notebook and starting to write in it.)  SHERLOCK: Some people who aren’t geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others.  JOHN: Hang on – you were saying “Sorry” a minute ago. Don’t spoil it. Go on: what have I done that’s so bloody stimulating?  (Sherlock stops just outside the pub door and turns back to John, showing what he has just written in his notebook:   HOUND   JOHN: Yeah?  SHERLOCK (pulling the notebook back and writing in it again): But what if it’s not a word? What if it is individual letters?  (He shows him the page of the notebook again, which now reads:   H.O.U.N.D."
JOHN," You think it’s an acronym?  SHERLOCK (putting his notebook away): Absolutely no idea but ...  (He turns towards the pub door and trails off when he sees a familiar figure standing inside at the bar. Wearing grey trousers and a grey shirt with a light jacket over the top, heavily suntanned and with sunglasses on, Detective Inspector Lestrade has his hands in his trouser pockets and is looking the absolute epitome of casual drop-dead gorgeousness. Fandom’s underwear simultaneously explodes worldwide and hello, Inspector, have you come to take down my particulars? Your transcriber sticks her head into a bucket of cold water for a minute and then gets back to work as Sherlock storms into the pub.)  SHERLOCK: What the hell are you doing here?  LESTRADE: Well, nice to see you too(!) I’m on holiday, would you believe?  SHERLOCK: No, I wouldn’t.  LESTRADE (taking off his sunglasses as John walks over to the bar): Hullo, John.  JOHN: Greg!  LESTRADE: I heard you were in the area. What are you up to? You after this Hound of Hell like on the telly?  SHERLOCK: I’m waiting for an explanation, Inspector. Why are you here?  LESTRADE: I’ve told you: I’m on holiday.  SHERLOCK: You’re brown as a nut. You’re clearly just back from your ‘holidays.’  LESTRADE (trying to look nonchalant): Yeah, well I fancied another one.  SHERLOCK: Oh, this is Mycroft, isn’t it?  LESTRADE: No, look ...  SHERLOCK: Of course it is! One mention of Baskerville and he sends down my handler to ... to spy on me incognito. Is that why you’re calling yourself Greg?  JOHN: That’s his name.  SHERLOCK (frowning): Is it?  LESTRADE: Yes – if you’d ever bothered to find out. Look, I’m not your handler ... (he turns away to pick up his pint from the bar) ... and I don’t just do what your brother tells me.  JOHN: Actually, you could be just the man we want.  SHERLOCK: Why?  JOHN: Well, I’ve not been idle, Sherlock. (He rummages in his trouser pocket.) I think I might have found something.  (He shows Sherlock the sales invoice from Undershaw Meat Supplies which he stole off the bar while he was checking in.)  JOHN: Here. Didn’t know if it was relevant; starting to look like it might be. That is an awful lot of meat for a vegetarian restaurant.  SHERLOCK: Excellent.  JOHN (looking at Greg): Nice scary inspector from Scotland Yard who can put in a few calls might come in very handy.  (Sherlock and Greg exchange a look, and John slaps his hand down on the bell on top of the bar.)  JOHN: Shop!   Later, in the small Snug next to the bar, Greg is sitting at a table looking through paperwork – presumably previous invoices from Undershaw – while Gary the manager and Billy the chef sit at the other side of the table looking at him anxiously. Nearby, Sherlock has poured a cup of coffee from a filter machine and is stirring it. He ostentatiously taps the drips off the spoon into the cup and then picks up the cup and its saucer and carries them over to John, offering them to him.  JOHN: What’s this?  SHERLOCK: Coffee. I made coffee.  JOHN: You never make coffee.  SHERLOCK: I just did. Don’t you want it?  JOHN: You don’t have to keep apologising.  (Sherlock looks away with a hurt expression on his face. John relents and takes the cup and saucer.)  JOHN: Thanks.  (Sherlock smiles happily. John lifts the cup to his mouth, takes a mouthful and grimaces.)  JOHN: Mm. I don’t take sugar ...  (The hurt expression comes back onto Sherlock’s face as he looks away again. He’s like a puppy whose owner has just told him off for chewing his slippers. John looks at his face and feels that he has no choice but to take a longer drink from the cup.)  LESTRADE: These records go back nearly two months.  (Grimacing at the taste, John puts the cup back into the saucer and looks at Sherlock.)  JOHN: That’s nice. That’s good.  (He turns away to put the drink down on a nearby mantelpiece while Greg continues interrogating Gary and Billy.)  LESTRADE: Is that when you had the idea, after the TV show went out?  BILLY: It’s me. It was me. (He turns to his partner.) I’m sorry, Gary – I couldn’t help it. I had a bacon sandwich at Cal’s wedding and one thing just led to another ...  (Sherlock grins behind him. Greg is equally disbelieving.)  LESTRADE: Nice try.  GARY: Look, we were just trying to give things a bit of a boost, you know? A great big dog run wild up on the moor – it was heaven-sent. It was like us having our own Loch Ness Monster.  LESTRADE: Where do you keep it?  GARY: There’s an old mineshaft. It’s not too far. It was all right there.  SHERLOCK: “Was”?  GARY (sighing): We couldn’t control the bloody thing. It was vicious. (He sighs again.) And then, a month ago, Billy took him to the vet and, er ... you know.  JOHN: It’s dead?  GARY: Put down.  BILLY: Yeah. No choice. So it’s over.  GARY: It was just a joke, you know?  LESTRADE: Yeah, hilarious(!)  (He stands up and looks down at them angrily.)  LESTRADE: You’ve nearly driven a man out of his mind.  (He walks out of the room. John follows him. Sherlock watches him go, then peers into John’s coffee cup before following. John follows Greg across the bar and out of the pub.)  JOHN: You know he’s actually pleased you’re here?  (Greg throws him a disbelieving look.)  JOHN: Secretly pleased.  LESTRADE: Is he? That’s nice(!) I suppose he likes having all the same faces back together. Appeals to his ... his ...  (He stops and searches for the right word. John provides an appropriate suggestion.)  JOHN: ... Asperger’s?  (Sherlock comes out of the pub and glowers at John, having heard the last word.)  LESTRADE: So, you believe him about having the dog destroyed?  SHERLOCK: No reason not to.  LESTRADE: Well, hopefully there’s no harm done. Not quite sure what I’d charge him with anyway. I’ll have a word with the local Force.  (He nods to the boys.)  LESTRADE: Right, that’s that, then. Catch you later. (He smiles.) I’m enjoying this! It’s nice to get London out of your lungs!  (John watches him walk away, then turns to Sherlock.)  JOHN: So that was their dog that people saw out on the moor?  SHERLOCK: Looks like it.  JOHN: But that wasn’t what you saw. That wasn’t just an ordinary dog.  SHERLOCK: No. (His gaze become distant.) It was immense, had burning red eyes and it was glowing, John. Its whole body was glowing.  (He shudders, shaking off the memory, then turns and walks towards the car park.)  SHERLOCK: I’ve got a theory but I need to get back into Baskerville to test it.  JOHN: How? Can’t pull off the ID trick again.  SHERLOCK: Might not have to.  (He has just taken out his phone and hit a speed dial and now he lifts the phone to his ear.)  SHERLOCK (insincerely into phone): Hello, brother dear. How are you?   BASKERVILLE. After many generic scenes of some of the scientific experiments being conducted at the facility, none of which your humble transcriber can be bothered to type out [buy the DVD and support your favourite production team!], Doctor Stapleton can be seen handling a fluffy white bunny inside a large clear plastic dome. At the entrance gates, the Land Rover approaches and stops. An armed security man goes over to Sherlock’s side while the dog handler and sniffer dog also approach.  SECURITY GUARD: Afternoon, sir. If you could turn the engine off.  (Sherlock hands over his ID pass and switches the car off.)  SECURITY GUARD: Thank you.  (As he goes over to the gate room to swipe the card and other soldiers check the vehicle over from the outside, Sherlock speaks quietly to John.)  SHERLOCK: I need to see Major Barrymore as soon as we get inside.  JOHN: Right.  SHERLOCK: Which means you’ll have to start the search for the hound.  JOHN: Okay.  SHERLOCK: In the labs; Stapleton’s first.  (The guard brings back the ID card and hands it over.)  SHERLOCK (quietly to John): Could be dangerous.  (John smiles momentarily. The gate slides open and Sherlock starts the car and drives onto the base.)   LATER. MAJOR BARRYMORE’S OFFICE. The major sits at his desk talking snarkily to Sherlock who is standing in the doorway.  BARRYMORE: Oh, you know I’d love to. I’d love to give you unlimited access to this place. Why not?(!)  SHERLOCK: It’s a simple enough request, Major.  BARRYMORE: I’ve never heard of anything so bizarre.  SHERLOCK: You’re to give me twenty-four hours. It’s what I’ve ... (he pauses momentarily) ... negotiated.  BARRYMORE (sternly): Not a second more. I may have to comply with this order but I don’t have to like it.  (He swings around to his computer on the desk behind him as Sherlock starts to leave the office.)  BARRYMORE: I don’t know what you expect to find here anyway.  SHERLOCK (turning back): Perhaps the truth.  BARRYMORE (looking round again): About what? Oh, I see. The big coat should have told me.  (Sherlock frowns.)  BARRYMORE: You’re one of the conspiracy lot, aren’t you?  (He grins as Sherlock rolls his eyes.)  BARRYMORE: Well, then, go ahead, seek them out: the monsters, the death rays, the aliens.  SHERLOCK (nonchalantly): Have you got any of those?  (Now it’s Barrymore’s turn to roll his eyes.)  SHERLOCK: Oh, just wondering.  BARRYMORE (leaning forward secretively): A couple. Crash landed here in the sixties. (Sarcastically) We call them Abbott and Costello.  (He straightens up and turns back to his computer.)  BARRYMORE: Good luck, Mr Holmes."
  HENRY," Oh, God!  (Sobbing, he clutches at his head and then buries his face in his hands and weeps in despair.)   BASKERVILLE. The lift doors open into the first lab that the boys previously visited but this time only John comes out of the elevator. Walking forward he sees that there are only two scientists in the room and they are now leaving through a side door. One of them turns off the main overhead lights as he goes, which leaves the room lit far more dimly by a few arc lights on stands which are dotted around, and by the screens of some computers. John looks around a little anxiously when he realises how spooky and quiet it is, then he walks towards a door at the far end of the lab, the door which Doctor Frankland came out of on the first occasion that they met him. He has a security pass in his pocket and he takes it out and swipes it through the reader, then pulls the door open and goes inside, having apparently ignored – or been too BAMF to care about – the handwritten notice stuck on the outside which reads:   KEEP OUT  UNLESS YOU WANT  A COLD!"
  JOHN," Oh, no! Jesus! Ow!  (Opening his eyes a little, he squints and tries to see into the room. All the other lights in the room appear to have come on as well and – with his own vision blanked out by the arc lights – there’s a wall of whiteness all around him. Just then a loud insistent alarm begins to blare into the room. John groans and covers his ears, completely overwhelmed by the bright light, lack of vision and the noise. Grimacing, he starts to make his way across the lab towards the lift, holding his hand up in front of his eyes as the after-image of the arc lights keeps blanking out his vision. Finally reaching the other end of the lab, he pulls out the ID card and swipes it through the reader. It whines and tells him “ACCESS DENIED”. He stares in disbelief and swipes the card again but it whines and gives him the same message. Holding one hand to an ear while the alarm continues to blare, he tries once more.)  JOHN: Come on.  (The same whine and message is repeated. John glares at it in exasperation – and at that moment all the lights go out and the alarm drones into silence. The room is now under emergency lighting only, which is dark red and barely illuminates the area.)  JOHN (under his breath): What the f...?  (He scrabbles in his pocket for his flashlight and switches it on, although its beam isn’t very helpful against the continued after-image of the arc lights which is still affecting his retinas. He calls out.)  JOHN: Hello?  (He screws his eyes shut for a moment in a failed attempt to clear the after-images. As he opens his eyes again and peers through the bright dots, a shadow seems to flicker across the room some distance away. John blinks and looks around the room, the after-images still frustrating his ability to see anything clearly. He lowers his head into his hand and rubs his eyes for a few seconds, then raises his head again, realising how ominously quiet it now is in the lab. But that doesn’t last long, because something rattles to his right. He walks forward cautiously, looking a little anxiously at the row of large cages which he now realises are all covered with sheeting which obscures their contents. The rattle sounds again. John walks slowly to the first of the cages, turning once to check behind him, then grabs hold of the sheeting and pulls it back to show that the first cage is empty. Pulling the sheet back down again, he walks to the next cage as something clinks near the lift doors. He swings around to look and shines his torch in that direction but can see nothing. He turns again and grabs the sheet over the second cage, tossing that back. Again the cage is empty, and the door is open. He moves on to the third cage and throws back the sheet. The monkey inside hurls itself towards him, screaming as it grabs at the bars. John drops the sheet and stumbles back several paces, breathing heavily. He walks to the final cage and looks at it, then slowly his gaze is pulled down to the bottom of the bars where the sheeting has been pushed back a little. The door of the cage is slightly ajar and the bottom of it has been bent back by something which must be incredibly strong. As John stares at the bent bars in disbelief, a low savage growl sounds behind him. John spins around, his eyes going wide as he shines his flashlight around but he can see nothing. He sees the nearby door to the Cold Lab and walks briskly over to it, taking out his ID card and swiping it. The reader whines its ACCESS DENIED alert.)  JOHN: No, come on, come on.  (He swipes the card again. Again it refuses to open the door. He stares in anguish, then pulls his mobile out of his pocket while shining his light around the room. He hits the speed dial and holds the phone to his ear as it begins to ring out and continues to ring.)  JOHN (under his breath): No, you ... Don’t be ridiculous, pick up.  (Eventually he gives up and switches off the phone.)  JOHN (in a whisper): Oh, dammit!  (Putting the phone back in his pocket he looks across the room determinedly.)  JOHN (softly): Right.  (Trying to shine his torch in all directions at once and making his way cautiously around all the workstations and islands, he hurries as quickly as he can towards the side door through which the scientists left earlier. As he goes, the distinctive sound of claws on floor tiles skitters across the room.)  JOHN (under his breath): Oh sh...  (Ducking low, he hurries to the door and takes out his card again.)  JOHN (in a whisper): Okay ...  (As he reaches towards the card reader, the claws trot across the floor to his right, and then something snarls. John turns and stares, breathing heavily, as there are more sounds nearby – claws on the floor tiles, equipment being pushed aside, and then a deep ominous growl. John shoves the card back into his pocket and then claps his hand over his mouth to dampen his own panicked breathing while the growl rumbles on. As the growl finally falls silent, John makes a break for it and races across the room, running towards the cages and pulling open the door of one of the empty ones before scrambling inside, slamming the door shut and bolting it and then reaching through the bars and pulling the sheet down over the cage. Elsewhere in the lab, the whatever-it-is snarls as John retreats from the door and squats down against the side bars, wrapping his hand around his mouth again and trying not to sob as the creature growls again.  Suddenly John’s phone starts to ring. Gasping, he scrabbles in his pocket to retrieve it. He answers it on the second ring and holds it up towards his mouth. He keeps his voice as soft as he possibly can but even at such a low volume his terror is evident.)  JOHN (softly): It’s here. It’s in here with me.  SHERLOCK (over phone): Where are you?  JOHN (softly): Get me out, Sherlock. You have got to get me out. The big lab: the first lab that we saw.  (He breathes heavily. Outside, the creature growls. John whines loudly in terror and claps his hand over his mouth again.)  SHERLOCK (over phone): John? John?  JOHN (lowering his hand and keeping his voice no more than a whisper): Now, Sherlock. Please.  SHERLOCK (over phone): All right, I’ll find you. Keep talking.  JOHN (softly): I can’t. It’ll hear me.  SHERLOCK (over phone): Keep talking. What are you seeing?  (Throughout the conversation John has been peering through the small gap in the sheeting but the room is so dimly lit that he hasn’t been able to see anything.)  SHERLOCK (over phone): John?  (The creature snarls again.)  JOHN (softly): Yes, I’m here.  SHERLOCK (insistently, over phone): What can you see?  (Getting onto his knees, John crawls closer to the gap in the sheeting, trying to keep his terrified breathing under control.)  JOHN (softly): I don’t know. I don’t know, but I can hear it, though.  (The creature growls loudly.)  JOHN (softly, terrified): Did you hear that?  SHERLOCK (over phone): Stay calm, stay calm. Can you see it?  (John peers into the gloom.)  SHERLOCK (over phone): Can you see it?  JOHN (quietly): No. I can...  (He trails off, then slowly straightens up, retreats backwards and sits back against the side bars while his face fills with absolute horror.)  JOHN (in a whisper): I can see it.  (He stares ahead of himself, his eyes full of dread as a shadow begins to move on the other side of the sheeting.)  JOHN (flatly): It’s here.  (The shadow moves closer as the creature growls once more.)  JOHN (flatly): It’s here.  (The shadow moves closer ... and then the sheeting is tugged upwards and the lights come on in the lab at the same moment that Sherlock’s face appears on the other side of the cage, looking down anxiously at John as he pulls open the door and goes inside.)  SHERLOCK (worriedly): Are you all right?  (John’s eyes widen in utter bewilderment as Sherlock bends down to him and puts a hand onto his shoulder.)  SHERLOCK: John ...  JOHN: Jesus Christ ...  (He grabs the bars and pulls himself to his feet, hurrying out of the cage and stuffing his phone away as he turns back to his friend.)  JOHN (still breathless and panic-stricken): It was the hound, Sherlock. It was here. I swear it, Sherlock. It must ...  (He looks around the lab which – now fully illuminated – shows that there’s nowhere that a large monster can be hiding.)  JOHN: It must ...  (His voice becomes high-pitched.)  JOHN: Did ... did ... did you see it? You must have!  (Sherlock holds out a placatory hand towards him.)  SHERLOCK: It’s all right. It’s okay now.  JOHN (high-pitched, frantic and hysterical): NO IT’S NOT! IT’S NOT OKAY! I saw it. I was wrong!  (Sherlock shrugs while John breathes heavily.)  Sherlock (calmly): Well, let’s not jump to conclusions.  JOHN: What?  SHERLOCK: What did you see?  JOHN: I told you: I saw the hound.  SHERLOCK: Huge; red eyes?  JOHN: Yes.  SHERLOCK: Glowing?  JOHN: Yeah.  SHERLOCK: No.  JOHN: What?  SHERLOCK: I made up the bit about glowing. You saw what you expected to see because I told you. You have been drugged. We have all been drugged.  JOHN: Drugged?  SHERLOCK: Can you walk?  JOHN (his voice shaky): ’Course I can walk.  SHERLOCK: Come on, then. It’s time to lay this ghost.  (He turns and heads for the door. Still trying to catch his breath, John looks around the lab again, then stumbles after Sherlock.)   In a small room full of cages, Doctor Stapleton is examining a fluffy white rabbit on a metal table. She looks up when Sherlock comes through the door, followed by John.  STAPLETON: Oh. Back again? What’s on your mind this time?  SHERLOCK: Murder, Doctor Stapleton. Refined, cold-blooded murder.  (He reaches back and turns off the light switch by the door. The limited lighting coming from the window at the end of the room is just enough to show that the rabbit is glowing a bright green. Sherlock turns the lights back on.)  SHERLOCK: Will you tell little Kirsty what happened to Bluebell or shall I?  (He smiles unpleasantly at her. She sighs.)  STAPLETON: Okay. What do you want?  SHERLOCK: Can I borrow your microscope?"
  STAPLETON," Are you sure you’re okay?  (John looks up at her, blinking.)  STAPLETON: You look very peaky.  JOHN: No, I’m all right.  STAPLETON: It was the GFP gene from a jellyfish, in case you’re interested.  JOHN: What?  STAPLETON: In the rabbits.  JOHN: Mm, right, yes.  STAPLETON (proudly): Aequoria Victoria, if you really want to know.  (John looks up at her.)  JOHN: Why?  STAPLETON: Why not? We don’t ask questions like that here. It isn’t done.  (A short distance from them, Sherlock looks increasingly irritated as he picks up another slide and puts it under the microscope.)  STAPLETON: There was a mix-up, anyway. My daughter ended up with one of the lab specimens, so poor Bluebell had to go.  JOHN (cynically): Your compassion’s overwhelming.  STAPLETON (mockingly): I know. I hate myself sometimes.  JOHN: So, come on then. You can trust me – I’m a doctor. What else have you got hidden away up here?  (Exasperated, Sherlock takes out the slide again. Stapleton sighs.)  STAPLETON: Listen: if you can imagine it, someone is probably doing it somewhere. Of course they are.  (Sherlock is staring intently at his latest slide, then his eyes slide across to a nearby read-out on a screen.)  JOHN: And cloning?  STAPLETON: Yes, of course. Dolly the Sheep, remember?  [Click here for more information on Dolly.]  JOHN: Human cloning?  STAPLETON: Why not?  JOHN: What about animals? Not sheep ... big animals.  STAPLETON: Size isn’t a problem, not at all. The only limits are ethics and the law, and both those things can be ... very flexible. But not here – not at Baskerville.  (Furious, Sherlock stands up, snatches the latest slide out from under the ’scope and hurls it against the nearest wall.)  SHERLOCK (livid): It’s not there!  JOHN: Jesus!  SHERLOCK: Nothing there! Doesn’t make any sense.  STAPLETON: What were you expecting to find?  SHERLOCK (pacing): A drug, of course. There has to be a drug – a hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind. There’s no trace of anything in the sugar.  JOHN: Sugar?  SHERLOCK: The sugar, yes. It’s a simple process of elimination. I saw the hound – saw it as my imagination expected me to see it: a genetically engineered monster. But I knew I couldn’t believe the evidence of my own eyes, so there were seven possible reasons for it, the most possible being narcotics. Henry Knight – he saw it too but you didn’t, John. You didn’t see it. Now, we have eaten and drunk exactly the same things since we got to Grimpen apart from one thing: you don’t take sugar in your coffee.  JOHN: I see. So ...  SHERLOCK: I took it from Henry’s kitchen – his sugar. (He glares down at the microscope.) It’s perfectly all right.  JOHN: But maybe it’s not a drug.  SHERLOCK: No, it has to be a drug.  (He has sat on the stool with his head buried in his hands. Now he lowers his hands a little but keeps his head bowed and his eyes closed.)  SHERLOCK: But how did it get into our systems. How?  (Slowly he begins to raise his head, still keeping his eyes closed.)  SHERLOCK: There has to be something ...  (The word ‘hound’ keeps drifting across his mind’s eye. He turns his head repeatedly as he tries to follow the words inside his head.)  SHERLOCK: ... something ... ah, something ...  (His eyes open.)  SHERLOCK: ... something buried deep.  (Taking a sharp breath through his nose, he turns and points imperiously at Stapleton.)  SHERLOCK: Get out.  STAPLETON: What?  SHERLOCK: Get out. I need to go to my mind palace.  (John sags on his seat with an “Oh, not again” look.)  STAPLETON: Your what?  (Sherlock has already turned his head away again and is staring ahead of himself. John stands up and picks up his jacket.)  JOHN: He’s not gonna be doing much talking for a while. We may as well go.  (Sherlock is breathing deeply, focusing his thoughts. Stapleton follows John as he heads for the door.)  STAPLETON: His what?  JOHN: Oh, his mind palace. It’s a memory technique – a sort of mental map. You plot a map with a location – it doesn’t have to be a real place – and then you deposit memories there that ... Theoretically, you can never forget anything; all you have to do is find your way back to it.  STAPLETON: So this imaginary location can be anything – a house or a street.  JOHN: Yeah.  STAPLETON: But he said “palace.” He said it was a palace.  JOHN (looking back towards Sherlock for a moment): Yeah, well, he would, wouldn’t he?  (He leads her out of the room.  Sherlock gazes ahead of himself, his mind turned inwards as he walks through his memories unearthing everything he can recall in connection with the word “Liberty.” I could possibly do much better justice to describing the visual process that we watch, but if you want this transcript online this side of the London Olympics, I need to get it finished and I may try to come back and improve this section in the future. Sherlock accesses different examples of the word and when he finds them unsuitable, he physically flicks them away with his hands and pulls in new variations before brushing those aside. The word “hound” creeps into his mind and drifts across it as he temporarily gives up on “Liberty” and shifts to “In,” adding various letters onto the word to form new ones like “Inn,” “India,” “Ingolstadt” [and ‘Frankenstein’ fans sob] and “Indium atomic number = 49”.  Flicking that line of thought away, he starts calling up images of large dogs, running through various breeds and temporarily being distracted by the image of Elvis Presley starting to sing the first line of “Hound Dog.” Irritated, he brushes that aside and tries to pull in all three words – Liberty, In, Hound – simultaneously and suddenly his eyes snap open and he jolts three times as if he’s being repeatedly struck by lightning as the words finally crash into place:   Liberty,  Indiana  H.O.U.N.D.   He sinks back on his seat for a moment, then stands up and heads out of the lab.)   NIGHT TIME. THE MOORS. The hound howls and Henry races across the grass, his pistol in one hand, terrified as the hound snarls behind him. Henry runs on, glancing back repeatedly as he hears his pursuer gaining on him. Two red glowing eyes loom out of the darkness each time he looks around, but now he suddenly seems to realise that he has a gun in his hand and he turns and fires towards the eyes.  Glass shatters and Louise Mortimer screams and throws herself out of her chair in the sitting room of Henry’s house and cowers on the floor. Just beside her chair, the mirror on the wall has shattered under the impact of the bullet which Henry just fired into it. Sobbing and cowering, she looks up at Henry as he continues to aim at the mirror, his face blank, but now he comes back to himself and looks at the pistol in horror.  HENRY: Oh my God.  (Louise continues to sob.)  HENRY: Oh my God. Oh my God. I am so ... I am so sorry. I am so sorry.  (He turns and runs from the room.)"
  SHERLOCK," John.  JOHN: Yeah, I’m on it.  (He turns back to keep an eye on the door while Stapleton goes over to sit down at a computer.)  SHERLOCK: Project HOUND. Must have read about it and stored it away. An experiment in a CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana.  (He stands behind Stapleton while she types her User ID onto the computer, then adds her password. A request to “Enter Search String” comes up and she looks up at Sherlock who dictates the letters.)  SHERLOCK: H, O, U, N, D.  (She types in the letters and hits Enter. A message comes up saying “NO ACCESS. CIA Classified” and requesting an authorisation code.)  STAPLETON: That’s as far as my access goes, I’m afraid.  JOHN: Well, there must be an override and password.  STAPLETON: I imagine so, but that’d be Major Barrymore’s.  (Sherlock spins around and walks into Barrymore’s office.)  SHERLOCK: Password, password, password.  (Switching on the lights in the room he sits down at the desk.)  SHERLOCK: He sat here when he thought it up.  (Folding his hands in front of his mouth, he slowly spins a full circle on the chair, looking around the office as he goes. Stapleton comes to the doorway.)  SHERLOCK: Describe him to me.  STAPLETON: You’ve seen him.  SHERLOCK: But describe him.  STAPLETON: Er, he’s a bloody martinet, a throw-back, the sort of man they’d have sent into Suez.  SHERLOCK: Good, excellent. Old-fashioned, traditionalist; not the sort that would use his children’s names as a password. (He gestures towards the children’s drawings pinned on the board above the desk.) He loves his job; proud of it and this is work-related, so what’s at eye level?  (He rapidly scans around everything in the room without altering the angle of his eyes.)  SHERLOCK (gesturing to the right): Books. (Pointing to the left) Jane’s Defence Weekly – bound copies. (He looks to the right again and at the subject matter of some of the books on the bookshelf.) Hannibal; Wellington; Rommel; Churchill’s “History of the English-Speaking Peoples” – all four volumes.  (He stands up and looks at a bronze bust on a shelf.)  SHERLOCK: Churchill – well, he’s fond of Churchill. (He looks back to the bookcases again.) Copy of “The Downing Street Years”; one, two, three, four, five separate biographies of Thatcher.  (He looks down to a framed photograph on the desk of a man in uniform standing with his teenage son.)  SHERLOCK: Mid 1980s at a guess. Father and son: Barrymore senior. (Looking at the uniform of the older man) Medals: Distinguished Service Order.  (He looks around to John who has come to the office door.)  JOHN: That date? I’d say Falklands veteran.  SHERLOCK: Right. So Thatcher’s looking a more likely bet than Churchill.  (He walks out of the office and heads back towards the computer.)  STAPLETON (following him): So that’s the password?  SHERLOCK: No. With a man like Major Barrymore, only first name terms would do.  (Leaning down to the keyboard, he starts to type Margaret Thatcher’s first name into the “Auth code” box but stops when he reaches the penultimate letter. It’s possible that the password is limited to seven letters, or he may have already realised that it’s not the correct password. He narrows his eyes and deletes everything back to the first letter, then retypes it as “Maggie”. Looking into the screen and gritting his teeth ever so slightly, he hits Enter. The computer beeps happily and announces “OVERRIDE 300/421 ACCEPTED. Loading ...”  John comes over from the door to look at the screen. After a slight pause information begins to stream across the screen as everything related to Project H.O.U.N.D. becomes available. Sherlock’s concentration becomes intense while he takes it all in, focusing on certain phrases like “extreme suggestibility,” “fear and stimulus,” “conditioned terror,” “aerosol dispersal.” A photograph comes up of the project team posing happily together and he identifies the five project leaders amongst the larger group: Elaine Dyson, Mary Uslowski, Rick Nader, Jack O’Mara and Leonard Hansen. Clearing the photo from the screen he rearranges the names into another order: "
  STAPLETON," HOUND.  (She stares at the screen in growing horror as more information from the project appears and words and phrases are highlighted such as “Paranoia,” “Severe frontal lobe damage,” “Blood-brain,” “Gross cranial trauma,” “Dangerous acceleration,” “Multiple homicide,” accompanied by photographs of some of the subjects of the project screaming insanely.)  JOHN (softly): Jesus.  SHERLOCK (still scanning the information as it flows across the screen): Project HOUND: a new deliriant drug which rendered its users incredibly suggestible. They wanted to use it as an anti-personnel weapon to totally disorientate the enemy using fear and stimulus; but they shut it down and hid it away in 1986.  STAPLETON: Because of what it did to the subjects they tested it on.  SHERLOCK: And what they did to others. Prolonged exposure drove them insane – made them almost uncontrollably aggressive.  JOHN: So someone’s been doing it again – carrying on the experiments?  SHERLOCK: Attempting to refine it, perhaps, for the last twenty years.  STAPLETON: Who?  (John nods at the screen, indicating the names of the project leaders.)  JOHN: Those names mean anything to you?  STAPLETON: No, not a thing.  SHERLOCK (sighing): Five principal scientists, twenty years ago.  (He pulls up the photograph of the team and begins zooming in on individuals within it. The closer footage shows that they are all wearing identical sweatshirts. Looming out of a diamond pattern in the centre of the sweatshirts is a large snarling wolf’s head and the legend “H.O.U.N.D.” is printed underneath. There is some smaller text underneath but it’s not yet clear what it says. Sherlock continues to zoom in and out of the photo to look more closely at the faces.)  SHERLOCK: Maybe our friend’s somewhere in the back of the picture – someone who was old enough to be there at the time of the experiments in 1986 ...  (He stops when he sees a face he recognises, and rolls his eyes a little as he realises the truth.)  SHERLOCK: Maybe somebody who says “cell phone” because of time spent in America. You remember, John?  JOHN: Mm-hm.  (Brief flashback to Doctor Frankland giving a card to Sherlock and saying, “Here’s my, er, cell number.”)  SHERLOCK: He gave us his number in case we needed him.  STAPLETON (staring at the photo on the screen): Oh my God. Bob Frankland. But Bob doesn’t even work on ... I mean, he’s a virologist. This was chemical warfare.  SHERLOCK: It’s where he started, though ... and he’s never lost the certainty, the obsession that that drug really could work. Nice of him to give us his number. (He reaches into his pocket and takes out Frankland’s card.) Let’s arrange a little meeting.  (He walks away from the computer. John walks closer to it and looks at the last image – a very tight close-up of one of the sweatshirts. Stitched below the “H.O.U.N.D.” legend is the name of the American town and state where the project was based: “Liberty, In”.  Just then John’s phone begins to ring. He digs it out of his pocket and frowns at the number on the screen, apparently not recognising it. He answers.)  JOHN: Hello?  (Initially the only sound he can hear is a woman crying.)  JOHN: Who’s this?  MORTIMER (tearfully, over the phone): You’ve got to find Henry.  (John looks round to Sherlock.)  JOHN: It’s Louise Mortimer. (Into phone) Louise, what’s wrong?  MORTIMER (tearfully): Henry was ... was remembering; then ... he tried ...  (She gasps.)  MORTIMER: He’s got a gun. He went for the gun and tried to ...  JOHN: What?  (She breaks down in tears again.)  MORTIMER: He’s gone. You’ve got to stop him. I don’t know what he might do.  JOHN: Where-where are you?  MORTIMER: His house. I’m okay, I’m okay.  JOHN: Right: stay there. We’ll get someone to you, okay?  (Lowering his phone, he begins to text.)  SHERLOCK: Henry?  JOHN: He’s attacked her.  SHERLOCK: Gone?  JOHN: Mm.  SHERLOCK (hitting a speed dial on his own phone): There’s only one place he’ll go to: back to where it all started. (Into phone) Lestrade. Get to the Hollow. ... Dewer’s Hollow, now. And bring a gun."
  SHERLOCK," No, Henry, no! No!  (He and John scramble down the slope, shining their torches towards him. Henry stands up and stumbles backwards, waving the pistol vaguely in their direction. His voice is high-pitched and hysterical.)  HENRY: Get back. Get – get away from me!  JOHN: Easy, Henry. Easy. Just relax.  HENRY: I know what I am. I know what I tried to do!  JOHN: Just put the gun down. It’s okay.  HENRY (his voice hoarse with anguish): No, no, I know what I am!  SHERLOCK (as reassuring as he’ll ever sound): Yes, I’m sure you do, Henry. It’s all been explained to you, hasn’t it – explained very carefully.  HENRY: What?  SHERLOCK: Someone needed to keep you quiet; needed to keep you as a child to reassert the dream that you’d both clung on to, because you had started to remember.  (He begins to step closer to the young man.)  SHERLOCK: Remember now, Henry. You’ve got to remember what happened here when you were a little boy.  (Henry’s gun hand begins to droop momentarily but then he raises it again, his face full of his struggle to understand.)  HENRY: I thought it had got my dad – the hound. I thought ...  (He loses control and begins to scream in anguish.)  HENRY: Oh Je... oh Jesus, I don’t – I don’t know any more!  (Sobbing, he bends forward and aims the muzzle into his mouth again.)  JOHN (lurching forward towards him): No, Henry! Henry, for God’s sake!  SHERLOCK (urgently): Henry, remember. “Liberty In.” Two words; two words a frightened little boy saw here twenty years ago.  (Henry begins to calm a little but still remains hunched over with the gun’s muzzle against his mouth.)  SHERLOCK: You’d started to piece things together, remember what really happened here that night. It wasn’t an animal, was it, Henry?  (Henry starts to straighten up, blinking.)  SHERLOCK: Not a monster.  (Henry turns to look at him.)  SHERLOCK: A man.  (Henry’s eyes widen as the memories begin to come. In brief flashes he starts to relive the truth. As he has always remembered, his father is scrabbling at the ground trying to get away from his attacker, but now for the first time Henry can see that what is pulling him backwards across the earth is not a creature but a man wearing a dark leather old-fashioned gas mask. The glass of the two large eye pieces is tinted a dark red and in the limited light available the eye pieces seem to be glowing. Young Henry watches from partway up the slope, cringing and terrified as the attacker pummels at his father, half strangling him and then punching wildly at his face. Mr Knight manages to pull himself from under his assailant and starts to crawl away but the other man, growling fiercely, tugs him backwards and Henry’s father loses his balance and falls forward. His head strikes a rock and he collapses to the ground unmoving. Breathing heavily through the gas mask, the other man pokes at him, realises that he isn’t going to move again and gets to his feet. He looks down at the man he has just killed and young Henry sees the sweatshirt he is wearing, with its picture of a snarling wolf-like creature, the letters “H.O.U.N.D.” underneath and “Liberty, In” below them. Young Henry’s mind begins to mix everything up and, some hours later when he meets the old lady walking her dog, his new horror is complete and he screams in utter terror.  In the present he gapes at Sherlock as the truth reasserts itself in his mind.)  SHERLOCK: You couldn’t cope. You were just a child, so you rationalised it into something very different. But then you started to remember, so you had to be stopped; driven out of your mind so that no-one would believe a word that you said.  (Quietly John steps forward, holding out his hand encouragingly towards Henry as Greg Lestrade arrives and calls out while he trots down the slope towards them.)  LESTRADE: Sherlock!  JOHN (gently to Henry): Okay, it’s okay, mate.  (He carefully takes the pistol from Henry’s fingers. Henry speaks tearfully to Sherlock.)  HENRY: But we saw it: the hound, last night. We s... we, we, we did, we saw ...  SHERLOCK: Yeah, but there was a dog, Henry, leaving footprints, scaring witnesses, but it was nothing more than an ordinary dog. We both saw it – saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it. Fear and stimulus; that’s how it works.  (Henry stares at him in confusion. Sherlock returns his look sympathetically.)  SHERLOCK: But there never was any monster.  (The hound has different ideas, however, and now its anguished howl rings out in the woods above them. Everyone’s head snaps up and John and Greg aim their flashlights upwards to the top of the Hollow where a low shape can be seen slowly stalking along the rim and snarling.)  JOHN: Sherlock ...  (Sherlock stares up in disbelief as Henry turns to him, horrified.)  HENRY: No. (He begins to wail in panic.) No, no, no, no!  (He backs away as Sherlock tries simultaneously to hold out a calming hand towards him while keeping his own torch shining up towards the creature above them.)  SHERLOCK: Henry, Henry ...  JOHN: Sherlock ...  (The creature continues to slink along the rim of the Hollow as Henry begins to scream in abject terror. He crumples to his knees, continually screaming, “No!”)  JOHN: Henry!  (The hound turns towards the Hollow and looks down at everyone, snarling viciously. Its eyes glow in the torchlight as Henry continues to wail.)  LESTRADE (staring up at the rim): Shit!  (John turns and shines his torch into his face.)  JOHN: Greg, are you seeing this?  (Greg glances at him momentarily and his expression answers the question. Sherlock takes a quick look around to the inspector to see his face before turning back to stare up at the hound.)  JOHN: Right: he is not drugged, Sherlock, so what’s that? What is it?!  (As Henry continues to wail behind them, Sherlock screws his eyes shut for a brief moment, trying to handle the overload in his mind. He stares upwards again.)  SHERLOCK: All right! It’s still here ... (he pants heavily for a moment before pulling himself together) ... but it’s just a dog. Henry! It’s nothing more than an ordinary dog!  (The hound doesn’t think so and it raises its head and lets out a long terrifying howl.)  LESTRADE (stumbling backwards): Oh my God.  (And now the hound turns and leaps a short way down the slope, its eyes flashing red in the torchlight.)  LESTRADE: Oh, Christ!  (John stares at it as it stops again, its red glowing eyes now clearly visible as it opens its mouth and reveals a mouthful of long pointed teeth that you would never see on any dog. Its snarl is completely terrifying. Henry has fallen silent, gazing up at it as if he knows that it is going to kill him shortly. Sherlock is still trying to believe what his own eyes are telling him ... and now there’s movement behind them. Sherlock looks over his shoulder and sees a tall human figure through the mist. The new arrival is wearing a breathing mask with a clear visor over his face. Sherlock turns and rushes towards him, grabbing at the mask and ripping it upwards to fully reveal the man’s face ... and Jim Moriarty grins manically back at him.)  SHERLOCK (staring at him in appalled horror): No!  (Behind him the hound growls ominously again. Jim’s expression becomes intense and murderous but then his head begins to distort and flail about, morphing between Jim’s face and someone else’s so quickly that it’s impossible to keep up with the changes. Sherlock grimaces, groaning at the insanity going on in front of him while Jim’s face keeps reasserting itself.)  SHERLOCK (frantically): It’s not you! You’re not here!  (Grabbing at the figure, he spins him around and then headbutts him in the face. The figure crumples slightly and raises his hand to his face as he straightens up ... and now the man in front of Sherlock is Bob Frankland. Sherlock clings onto his jacket, his breathing panicked and frantic ... but then he turns his head to one side and looks at the mist surrounding them. Frankland still has his hand clamped over his mouth and nose, and suddenly it all begins to make sense to Sherlock.)  SHERLOCK: The fog.  JOHN (still aiming his torch up at the hound): What?  SHERLOCK: It’s the fog! The drug: it’s in the fog! Aerosol dispersal – that’s what it said in those records. Project HOUND – it’s the fog! A chemical minefield!  (Greg instantly throws his arm across his face, trying to stop himself from breathing too much of the mist. The hound stalks closer to the group, snarling.)  FRANKLAND: For God’s sake, kill it! Kill it!  (The hound’s movements become more jittery as if it’s winding itself up to attack. Greg aims his pistol and fires three times at it. His bullets fly past it and it flinches momentarily but then rises up and leaps towards them. John’s aim is truer and his bullets strike the hound accurately and throw it backwards. It squeals in pain and crashes to the ground, unmoving. John and Greg watch it anxiously for any signs of movement, and Sherlock runs over to Henry and pushes him towards the hound.)  SHERLOCK: Look at it, Henry.  HENRY (digging his heels in): No, no, no!  SHERLOCK (shoving him forward determinedly): Come on, look at it!  (He bullies the young man forward until they can both clearly see it lying on the ground. In Sherlock’s torchlight it is evidently nothing more than a huge dog. Henry stares at it for a moment and then turns back to where Frankland is still holding his injured face while Greg has his hands over his mouth as he tries to draw breath and come to terms with what he just experienced. Henry looks at Frankland.)  HENRY: It’s just ... You bastard.  (Hurling himself at the older man, he screams with rage.)  HENRY: You bastard!  (Bundling him to the ground, he screams into his face while John and Greg run over and try to pull him off.)  HENRY: Twenty years! Twenty years of my life making no sense! Why didn’t you just kill me?!  (Finally the others manage to pull him up.)  SHERLOCK: Because dead men get listened to. He needed to do more than kill you. He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father, and he had the means right at his feet – a chemical minefield; pressure pads in the ground dosing you up every time that you came back here.  (He holds his arms out wide and spins slowly in a circle, gesturing around the Hollow.)  SHERLOCK: Murder weapon and scene of the crime all at once.  (He laughs with delight.)  SHERLOCK: Oh, this case, Henry! Thank you. It’s been brilliant.  JOHN: Sherlock ...  SHERLOCK (turning to him): What?  (John glares at him pointedly.)  JOHN: Timing.  SHERLOCK: Not good?  HENRY: No, no, it’s – it’s okay. It’s fine, because this means ...  (He starts to step towards Frankland. John moves with him, ready to intervene if he should try to attack him again.)  HENRY: ... this means that my dad was right.  (Frankland gets up onto his knees as Henry still tries to move towards him. John and Greg both put a gentle hand onto his shoulders to keep him back.)  HENRY (tearfully): He found something out, didn’t he, and that’s why you’d killed him – because he was right, and he’d found you right in the middle of an experiment.  (Frankland gets to his feet but before he can say anything there’s a savage snarl from behind the group. Everybody spins towards the dog [and bizarrely, when the camera angle changes it looks as if John and Greg were just having a cuddle before they were interrupted]. The dog whines in pain but gets up off the ground. John aims and fires towards it twice and it goes down again. Frankland takes the opportunity of the distraction to turn and run off in the opposite direction. Like the single-minded idiot that he is, Sherlock runs right across John’s line of fire, forcing him to lower his pistol, and chases off after the scientist. John turns and follows him up the slope.)  SHERLOCK: Frankland!  (Frankland runs through the woods with Sherlock and John in hot pursuit, Greg and Henry a little behind the other two.)  SHERLOCK: Frankland!  LESTRADE (to Henry): Come on, keep up!  (They run on.)  SHERLOCK: It’s no use, Frankland!  (Reaching the barbed wire fence surrounding the minefield, Frankland doesn’t hesitate and jumps over. His feet tangle in the wire and he falls to the ground on the other side. He jumps up and runs on a few yards but then stops abruptly when his foot thumps down onto a mine, which makes a distinctive clink indicating that he has activated its pressure pad. He stares down at his foot, shining his torch onto the mine underneath and realising that unless he remains completely still and doesn’t lift any pressure off it, the mine will blow. As the others hurry towards the barbed wire, he raises his head, sighs in resignation and deliberately lifts his foot. The others skid to a halt and duck down as a massive explosion rips into the air. As the blast dies down, Henry sinks back against a nearby tree while Sherlock gazes reflectively across the minefield.)"
  JOHN," Mmm. Thanks, Billy.  (As Billy walks away, Sherlock brings over two mugs and puts one down on the table.)  SHERLOCK: So they didn’t have it put down, then – the dog.  JOHN (tucking into his breakfast while Sherlock stands next to him and drinks his coffee): Obviously. Suppose they just couldn’t bring themselves to do it.  SHERLOCK: I see.  JOHN (smiling): No you don’t.  SHERLOCK: No, I don’t. Sentiment?  JOHN: Sentiment!  SHERLOCK (rolling his eyes): Oh.  (He sits down on the bench next to John.)  JOHN: Listen: what happened to me in the lab?  (Sherlock looks at him for a moment, then turns around and reaches for a box of sauce sachets, looking worried about how he’s ever going to explain all this.)  SHERLOCK: D’you want some sauce with that?  JOHN: I mean, I hadn’t been to the Hollow, so how come I heard those things in there? Fear and stimulus, you said.  SHERLOCK (rummaging through the box of sachets): You must have been dosed with it elsewhere, when you went to the lab, maybe. You saw those pipes – pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve; and they were carrying the gas, so ... Um, ketchup, was it, or brown ...?  JOHN: Hang on: you thought it was in the sugar.  (Sherlock stares at him while trying to maintain a neutral expression.)  JOHN: You were convinced it was in the sugar.  (Sherlock looks away again.)  SHERLOCK: Better get going, actually. (He looks at his watch.) There’s a train that leaves in half an hour, so if you want ...  (John turns his head away as he begins to realise the horrible truth.)  JOHN: Oh God. It was you. You locked me in that bloody lab.  SHERLOCK: I had to. It was an experiment.  JOHN (furiously): An experiment?!  SHERLOCK (looking at people sitting nearby): Shhh.  JOHN (quieter, but still furious): I was terrified, Sherlock. I was scared to death.  SHERLOCK: I thought that the drug was in the sugar, so I put the sugar in your coffee, then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore.  (John sighs in exasperation.)  SHERLOCK: It was all totally scientific, laboratory conditions – well, literally.  (Flashback to Sherlock alone in a room from where he can monitor the lab. Lazily sitting in a chair with his feet up on the table, he watches the screen in front of him which shows John racing across the darkened lab towards the cages as the ‘hound’ growls. A little later Sherlock wiggles his feet comfortably on the desk while John breathes panic-stricken into his phone. John can’t be seen on the screen because he’s hidden inside the cage.)  JOHN (whispering over phone): It’s in here with me.  SHERLOCK (into his phone): All right. Keep talking. I’ll find you.  (There’s a momentary silence.)  SHERLOCK (into phone): Keep talking!  JOHN (over phone): I can’t, it’ll hear me.  SHERLOCK: Tell me what you’re seeing!  (He switches on a small recorder and holds it up to a nearby microphone. Savage growling is played into the lab.)  JOHN (over phone): I don’t know, but I can hear it now.  (Back in the present, Sherlock continues his ‘explanation.’)  SHERLOCK: Well, I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind, so I needed to try it on an average one.  (John looks up from his plate.)  SHERLOCK: You know what I mean.  (John gets back to eating.)  JOHN: But it wasn’t in the sugar.  SHERLOCK: No, well, I wasn’t to know you’d already been exposed to the gas.  JOHN: So you got it wrong.  SHERLOCK: No.  JOHN: Mm. You were wrong. It wasn’t in the sugar. You got it wrong.  SHERLOCK: A bit. It won’t happen again.  (Sighing, John continues eating, then looks round.)  JOHN: Any long-term effects?  SHERLOCK: None at all. You’ll be fine once you’ve excreted it. We all will.  JOHN: Think I might have taken care of that already.  (Sherlock snorts laughter, then looks across to a nearby table where Gary is pouring coffee for two other customers. He smiles apologetically across to Sherlock, who puts his mug on the table and stands up.)  JOHN: Where’re you going?  SHERLOCK: Won’t be a minute. Gotta see a man about a dog.  (Smiling down at John, he turns and walks away.)    Jim Moriarty sits silently and calmly with his eyes closed in the middle of a small windowless concrete-lined cell. In an adjoining room, Mycroft walks towards the other side of the one-way mirror which Jim is facing, and narrows his eyes as he looks closely at the other man.   Some time afterwards, the door to the cell is unlocked and Jim opens his eyes but does not turn around as Mycroft walks in.   Later, Mycroft has left the cell again. A man in a suit has opened the cell door and has walked inside.  MYCROFT (voiceover): All right. Let him go.  (Jim turns and casually strolls out of the cell. Behind him, the man turns and looks around the room. On almost every plain concrete panel of the walls, Jim has somehow carved a single word into the cement. In different sizes and at different angles, the word repeats all around the cell – and the word is SHERLOCK.  And with the dust which was loosened by the carving, Jim has scratched Sherlock’s name backwards on the mirror so that whoever is watching him from the other side of the mirror will see the name the right way round.  The man in the suit turns and walks away, closing the cell door behind him.)"
JOHN, D’you want to hear me say it? 
ELLA, Eighteen months since our last appointment. 
ELLA, Sometimes. 
JOHN," Mmm, and you watch telly? You know why I’m here. "
JOHN, I’m here because ... 
ELLA," What happened, John? "
JOHN, ... is dead.

DIRECTOR, A small token of our gratitude. 
SHERLOCK, Diamond cufflinks. All my cuffs have buttons. 
SHERLOCK, Do I? 
JOHN, Just say it. 
JOHN, Hey. 
 The text of the article reads," “A Turner masterpiece worth £1.7million that was stolen from an auction house ten days ago has been recovered by an amateur detective from North London. Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street has been investigating the art crime simply as a hobby, and yet he was able to follow the trail that lead [sic] him to the famous work – a trail that Scotland Yard missed completely.

New article," “Ricoletti evades capture”. Your transcriber is already nearing page three of this transcript and is only two and a half minutes into the episode so let’s leave out the text of the article, but it suggests that the man named in the headline was responsible for the banker’s kidnap. We cut to Scotland Yard where D.I. Greg Lestrade is addressing a press conference. Sherlock and John stand nearby, and D.S. Sally Donovan and Doctor WhoCaresWhatHisFirstNameIs Anderson are at the back of the room.) "
LESTRADE, Peter Ricoletti: number one on Interpol’s Most Wanted list since 1982. But we got him; and there’s one person we have to thank for giving us the decisive leads ... with all his customary diplomacy and tact(!)

JOHN, Tabloid nickname: ‘SuBo’; ‘Nasty Nick.’ Shouldn’t worry – I’ll probably get one soon. 
SHERLOCK," Page five, column six, first sentence. "
SHERLOCK, Why is it always the hat photograph? 
SHERLOCK, What sort of hat is it anyway? 
JOHN, “Bachelor”? What the hell are they implying? 
SHERLOCK, You stalk a deer with a hat? What are you gonna do – throw it? 
SHERLOCK, Some sort of death frisbee? 
JOHN," Okay, this is too much. We need to be more careful. "
SHERLOCK," It’s got flaps ... ear flaps. It’s an ear hat, John. "
SHERLOCK," What do you mean, “more careful”? "
JOHN, I mean this isn’t a deerstalker now; it’s a Sherlock Holmes hat. I mean that you’re not exactly a private detective any more. (He holds his thumb and forefinger an inch apart.) You’re this far from famous. 
SHERLOCK," Oh, it’ll pass. "
JOHN," It’d better pass. The press will turn, Sherlock. They always turn, and they’ll turn on you. "
SHERLOCK, It really bothers you. 
JOHN, What? 
SHERLOCK, What people say. 
JOHN, Yes. 
SHERLOCK, About me? I don’t understand – why would it upset you? 
JOHN, Just try to keep a low profile. Find yourself a little case this week. Stay out of the news. 
JOHN, It’s your phone. 
JOHN," So, did you just talk to him for a really long time? "
SHERLOCK, Oh. Henry Fishgard never committed suicide. 
SHERLOCK, Bow Street Runners: missed everything.

SHERLOCK, Not now. 
 The message on the screen reads, 
LESTRADE, That glass is tougher than anything. 
SHERLOCK, Not tougher than crystallised carbon. He used a diamond. 
 the message reads, 
 and has run it on its front page with the headline," “Crime of the Century?” The rest of the text reads: “Questions are being asked in parliament as to how the Tower of London, Pentonville Prison and the Bank of England were all broken into at the same time by the same man – James Moriarty. // There are unconfirmed reports that Scotland Yard’s favourite sleuth Mr Sherlock Holmes has been called in to help the team piece together the most audacious crime ... Turn to page 5”. "
 reads," “Jewel Thief on trial at Bailey” and the first few paragraphs read: “Crown Jewel thief is to be tried at the Old Bailey and Sherlock Holmes is named as a witness for the prosecution. // Master criminal Moriarty taunted Holmes with his graffitied GET SHERLOCK at the scene of the crime. The crime is attracting huge attention internationally too. // Irish born Moriarty – of no fixed abode, seems to be taunting the master detective. // Boffin Holmes, accompanied by confirmed bachelor John Watson – refused to comment. // Crowds gathered yesterday for what is being described as the trial of the century.” [After that the text keeps repeating. Do the production team not know that we have the ability to freeze frame and read these articles because we are ludicrously obsessive and will not only notice the repetition but the annoying mixed up use of dashes and commas?!] "
 The picture is of Sherlock putting on the deerstalker hat at the Scotland Yard press conference and the text reads," “In a twist worthy of a Conan Doyle novella, Mr Sherlock Holmes was yesterday revealed to be an expert witness at the trial of ‘Jim’ Moriarty. Described by many commentators as the trial of the century, the case has all the ingredients of a block buster film. The royal family, Scotland yard [sic], the world of finance and greed, the ‘underclass’ of prisoners out to reek [sic] revenge as they enjoy their own fifteen minutes of freedom. The case is riddled with irony and intrigue but perhaps reflects a deeper malaise that seems to be at the heart of a society. // Mr Holmes, a man of few words, declined to comment when asked his involvement in the case. It is understood that a woefully depleted Scotland ...” [and then the text goes off the screen]. "

SHERLOCK, Yes. 
JOHN, Get in.

JOHN, Remember what they told you: don’t try to be clever ...

JIM, Would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket? 
JIM, Thanks. 
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT, Crown versus Moriarty – please proceed to Court Ten. 
KITTY, You’re him. 
SHERLOCK, Wrong toilet. 
KITTY, I’m a big fan. 
KITTY," I read your cases; follow them all. (She steps closer, gazing at him adoringly.) Sign my shirt, would you? "
SHERLOCK, There are two types of fans. 
KITTY, Oh? 
SHERLOCK, “Catch me before I kill again” – Type A ... 
KITTY, Uh-huh. What’s Type B? 
SHERLOCK, “Your bedroom’s just a taxi ride away.” 
KITTY, Guess which one I am. 
 and does a speed deduction, 
SHERLOCK, Neither. 
SHERLOCK, No. You’re not a fan at all. 
SHERLOCK," Those marks on your forearm: edge of a desk. You’ve been typing in a hurry, probably. Pressure on; facing a deadline. "
SHERLOCK, And there’s a smudge of ink on your wrist; and a bulge in your left jacket pocket. 
KITTY, Bit of a giveaway. 
SHERLOCK," The smudge is deliberate, to see if I’m as good as they say I am. "
SHERLOCK," Hmm. Oil-based, used in newspaper print, but drawn on with an index finger; your finger. "
KITTY, Hmm! 
SHERLOCK, Journalist. Unlikely you’d get your hands dirty at the press. You put that there to test me. 
KITTY," Wow, I’m liking you! "
SHERLOCK, You mean I’d make a great feature: “Sherlock Holmes – the man beneath the hat.” 
KITTY, Kitty ... (she takes off the hat) ... Riley. Pleased to meet you. 
SHERLOCK," No. I’m just saving you the trouble of asking. No, I won’t give you an interview; no, I don’t want the money. "
KITTY," You and John Watson – just platonic? Can I put you down for a “no” there, as well? "
KITTY, There’s all sorts of gossip in the press about you. Sooner or later you’re gonna need someone on your side ... 
KITTY, ... someone to set the record straight. 
KITTY," I’m smart, and you can trust me, totally. "
SHERLOCK," Smart, okay: investigative journalist. Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see. "
SHERLOCK," If you’re that skilful, you don’t need an interview. You can just read what you need. "
SHERLOCK," No? Okay, my turn. "
 And your nails," you can’t afford to do them that often. I see someone who’s hungry. I don’t see smart, and I definitely don’t see trustworthy, but I’ll give you a quote if you like – three little words. "
PROSECUTING BARRISTER, A “consulting criminal.” 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER, Your words. Can you expand on that answer? 
SHERLOCK, James Moriarty is for hire. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER, A tradesman? 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER, But not the sort who’d fix your heating. 
SHERLOCK," No, the sort who’d plant a bomb or stage an assassination, but I’m sure he’d make a pretty decent job of your boiler. "
PROSECUTING BARRISTER, Would you describe him as ... 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER, What? 
SHERLOCK, Can’t do that. You’re leading the witness. (He looks towards the defending barrister.) He’ll object and the judge will uphold. 
JUDGE, Mr Holmes. 
JUDGE," Mr Holmes, we’re fine without your help. "
PROSECUTING BARRISTER, How would you describe this man – his character? 
SHERLOCK, First mistake. (He raises his eyes and locks his gaze onto Jim.) James Moriarty isn’t a man at all – he’s a spider; a spider at the centre of a web – a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER, And how long ... 
SHERLOCK," How long have I known him? Not really your best line of enquiry. We met twice, five minutes in total. I pulled a gun; he tried to blow me up. (Sarcastically) I felt we had a special something. "
JUDGE," Miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert, after knowing the accused for just five minutes? "
SHERLOCK, Two minutes would have made me an expert. Five was ample. 
JUDGE," Mr Holmes, that’s a matter for the jury. "
SHERLOCK," Oh, really? "
SHERLOCK," One librarian; two teachers; two high-pressured jobs, probably the City. "
SHERLOCK," The foreman’s a medical secretary, trained abroad judging by her shorthand. "
JUDGE, Mr Holmes! 
SHERLOCK, Would you like to know who ate the wafer? 
JUDGE, Keep your answers brief and to the point. Anything else will be treated as contempt. 
JUDGE, Do you think you could survive for just a few minutes without showing off? 
JOHN," What did I say? I said, “Don’t get clever.” "
SHERLOCK, I can’t just turn it on and off like a tap. 
SHERLOCK, Well? 
JOHN, Well what? 
SHERLOCK," You were there for the whole thing, up in the gallery, start to finish. "
JOHN," Like you said it would be. (Referring to Jim’s defending barrister) He sat on his backside, never even stirred. "
SHERLOCK, Moriarty’s not mounting any defence. 
JOHN," Bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville. Three of the most secure places in the country and six weeks ago Moriarty breaks in, no-one knows how or why. "
JOHN, All we know is ... 
SHERLOCK, ... he ended up in custody. 
JOHN, Don’t do that. 
SHERLOCK, Do what? 
JOHN, The look. 
SHERLOCK, Look? 
JOHN, You’re doing the look again. 
SHERLOCK," Well, I can’t see it, can I? "
SHERLOCK, It’s my face. 
JOHN," Yes, and it’s doing a thing. You’re doing a “we both know what’s really going on here” face. "
SHERLOCK," Well, we do. "
JOHN," No. I don’t, which is why I find The Face so annoying. "
SHERLOCK," If Moriarty wanted the Jewels, he’d have them. If he wanted those prisoners free, they’d be out on the streets. The only reason he’s still in a prison cell right now is because he chose to be there. "
SHERLOCK, Somehow this is part of his scheme. 
JUDGE," Mr Crayhill, can we have your first witness? "
DEFENDING BARRISTER," Your Honour, we’re not calling any witnesses. "
JUDGE, I don’t follow. You’ve entered a plea of Not Guilty. 
DEFENDING BARRISTER," Nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence. The defence rests. "
JUDGE," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. James Moriarty stands accused of several counts of attempted burglary, crimes which – if he’s found guilty – will elicit a very long custodial sentence; and yet his legal team has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea. I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly. You must find him guilty. "
JUDGE, You must find him guilty. 
CLERK, They’re coming back. 
JOHN, That’s six minutes. 
CLERK," Surprised it took them that long, to be honest. There’s a queue for the loo. "
CLERK, Have you reached a verdict on which you all agree? 
SHERLOCK," Most people knock. (He shrugs.) But then you’re not most people, I suppose. "
SHERLOCK, Kettle’s just boiled. 
JIM, Johann Sebastian would be appalled. 
JIM, May I? 
JIM," You know when he was on his death bed, Bach, he heard his son at the piano playing one of his pieces. The boy stopped before he got to the end ... "
SHERLOCK," ... and the dying man jumped out of his bed, ran straight to the piano and finished it. "
JIM, Couldn’t cope with an unfinished melody. 
SHERLOCK, Neither can you. That’s why you’ve come. 
JIM, But be honest: you’re just a tiny bit pleased. 
SHERLOCK," What, with the verdict? "
JIM," With me ... (softly) ... back on the streets. (He gazes up into Sherlock’s eyes, smiling.) Every fairytale needs a good old-fashioned villain. "
JIM," You need me, or you’re nothing. Because we’re just alike, you and I – except you’re boring. "
JIM, You’re on the side of the angels. 
SHERLOCK," Got to the jury, of course. "
JIM, I got into the Tower of London; you think I can’t worm my way into twelve hotel rooms? 
SHERLOCK, Cable network. 
SHERLOCK, So how’re you going to do it ... 
SHERLOCK, ... burn me? 
JIM, What’s the final problem? 
JIM, I did tell you ... (sing-song but still softly) ... but did you listen? 
JIM," Oh, that’s clever; that’s very clever; awfully clever. "
JIM," Speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet? "
SHERLOCK, Told them what? 
JIM, Why I broke into all those places and never took anything. 
SHERLOCK, No. 
JIM, But you understand. 
SHERLOCK, Obviously. 
JIM," Off you go, then. "
SHERLOCK, You want me to tell you what you already know? 
JIM, No; I want you to prove that you know it. 
SHERLOCK, You didn’t take anything because you don’t need to. 
SHERLOCK, You’ll never need to take anything ever again. 
JIM, Very good. Because ...? 
SHERLOCK," Because nothing ... nothing in the Bank of England, the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match the value of the key that could get you into all three. "
JIM," I can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code. No such thing as a private bank account now – they’re all mine. No such thing as secrecy – I own secrecy. Nuclear codes – I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order. In a world with locked rooms, the man with the key is king; and honey, you should see me in a crown. "
SHERLOCK, You were advertising all the way through the trial. You were showing the world what you can do. 
JIM," And you were helping. Big client list: rogue governments, intelligence communities ... terrorist cells. They all want me. "
JIM," Suddenly, I’m Mr Sex. "
SHERLOCK," If you could break any bank, what do you care about the highest bidder? "
JIM," I don’t. I just like to watch them all competing. “Daddy loves me the best!” Aren’t ordinary people adorable? Well, you know: you’ve got John. I should get myself a live-in one. "
SHERLOCK, Why are you doing all of this? 
SHERLOCK, You don’t want money or power – not really. 
SHERLOCK, What is it all for? 
JIM," It’s gonna start very soon, Sherlock: the fall. "
JIM," But don’t be scared. Falling’s just like flying, except there’s a more permanent destination. "
SHERLOCK, Never liked riddles. 
JIM," Learn to. Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock. I ... owe ... you. "
 The opening paragraph reads," “The Judge could only look on dumbfounded as the Jury found ‘Jimbo’ Moriarty ‘Not Guilty’. Gasps were heard around the courtroom as the Jury declared their verdict”. “The Guardian” declares “Shock verdict at trial” and the article begins, “In an unbelievable turn of events Moriarty walked free today after putting up no defence at all for what has been described as the Trial of the Century. Star witness Sherlock Holmes was not present for the verdict as in another twist to the case was thrown out of court by the Judge. Questions have been asked in Parliament and the Prime Minister was quoted as saying ‘This is a disgrace, a sign if ever we needed one that broken Britain is still broken...” [and yes, they do open the quote with single speech marks, then close it with double speech marks]. The “Daily Star” goes with “How was he ever acquitted” [but apparently can’t be bothered to put a question mark after it]. "
 After a few seconds he is greeted with the onscreen message, 
John grimaces and a second later a new message appears, 
A moment later the message adds, 
JOHN," Er, excuse me. Um, I’m looking for Mycroft Holmes. "
JOHN, Would you happen to know if he’s around at all? 
JOHN, Can you not hear me? 
JOHN," Yes, all right. "
JOHN, Anyone? 
JOHN, Anyone at all know where Mycroft Holmes is? I’ve been asked to meet him here. 
JOHN, No takers? Right. (He raises his voice.) Am I invisible? Can you actually see me? 
JOHN," Ah, thanks, gents. "
JOHN, I’ve been asked to meet Mycroft Holm... 
JOHN, What the ...? Hey! 
Ariane transcripts, not only hopefully entertaining and useful but educational as well!] 
MYCROFT," Tradition, John. Our traditions define us. "
JOHN," So total silence is traditional, is it? You can’t even say, “Pass the sugar.” "
MYCROFT," Three-quarters of the diplomatic service and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley. It’s for the best, believe me. "
MYCROFT, They don’t want a repeat of 1972. But we can talk in here. 
JOHN, You read this stuff? 
MYCROFT, Caught my eye. 
MYCROFT, Saturday: they’re doing a big exposé. 
 The headline reads," “SHERLOCK: THE SHOCKING TRUTH” with the strapline “Close Friend Richard Brook Tells All”. The article reveals that it is an Exclusive from Kitty Riley and the text reads: “Super-sleuth Sherlock Holmes has today been exposed as a fraud in a revelation that will shock his new found base of adoring fans. // Out-of-work actor Richard Brook revealed exclusively to THE SUN that he was hired by Holmes in an elaborate deception to fool the British public into believing Holmes had above-average ‘detective skills’. // Brook, who has known Holmes for decades and until recently considered him to be a close friend, said he was at first desperate for the money, but later found he had no” [at which point the text just stops].) "
JOHN, I’d love to know where she got her information. 
MYCROFT, Someone called Brook. Recognise the name? 
JOHN," School friend, maybe? "
MYCROFT, Of Sherlock’s? (He chuckles again.) But that’s not why I asked you here. 
JOHN, Who’s that? 
MYCROFT, Don’t know him? 
JOHN, No. 
MYCROFT, Never seen his face before? 
MYCROFT," He’s taken a flat in Baker Street, two doors down from you. "
JOHN, Hmm! I was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours. 
MYCROFT, Not sure you’ll want to. (He nods towards the folder.) Sulejmani. Albanian hit squad. Expertly-trained killer living less than twenty feet from your front door. 
JOHN, It’s a great location. Jubilee line’s handy. 
MYCROFT, John ... 
JOHN, What’s it got to do with me? 
JOHN," Um, actually, I think I have seen her. "
MYCROFT, Russian killer. She’s taken the flat opposite. 
JOHN, I’m moving?! 
MYCROFT," It’s not hard to guess the common denominator, is it? "
JOHN, You think this is Moriarty? 
MYCROFT, He promised Sherlock he’d come back. 
JOHN," If this was Moriarty, we’d be dead already. "
MYCROFT," If not Moriarty, then who? "
JOHN, Why don’t you talk to Sherlock if you’re so concerned about him? 
JOHN," Oh God, don’t tell me. "
MYCROFT," Too much history between us, John. Old scores; resentments. "
JOHN, Nicked all his Smurfs? Broke his Action Man? 
MYCROFT," We both know what’s coming, John. "
MYCROFT, Moriarty is obsessed. He’s sworn to destroy his only rival. 
MYCROFT, If it’s not too much trouble. 
MAN," ’Scuse, mate. "
JOHN, Oh. 
JOHN," Sherlock, something weird ... "
JOHN, What’s going on? 
SHERLOCK, Kidnapping. 
LESTRADE," Rufus Bruhl, the ambassador to the U.S. "
JOHN," He’s in Washington, isn’t he? "
LESTRADE," Not him – his children, Max and Claudette, age seven and nine. "
LESTRADE, They’re at St Aldate’s. 
DONOVAN, Posh boarding place down in Surrey. 
DONOVAN, The kids have vanished. 
LESTRADE, The ambassador’s asked for you personally. 
LESTRADE, Isn’t it great to be working with a celebrity(!) 
SHERLOCK," Miss Mackenzie, you’re in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night. (His voice rises angrily.) What are you: an idiot, a drunk or a criminal? "
SHERLOCK, I do. I just wanted you to speak quickly. 
SHERLOCK, Miss Mackenzie will need to breathe into a bag now. 
JOHN," Six grand a term, you’d expect them to keep the kids safe for you. You said the other kids had all left on their holidays? "
LESTRADE, They were the only two sleeping on this floor. Absolutely no sign of a break-in. 
LESTRADE, The intruder must have been hidden inside some place. 
SHERLOCK, Show me where the brother slept. 
SHERLOCK," The boy sleeps there every night, gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor. He’d recognise every shape, every outline, the silhouette of everyone who came to the door. "
LESTRADE," Okay, so ... "
SHERLOCK," So someone approaches the door who he doesn’t recognise, an intruder. Maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon. "
SHERLOCK, What would he do in the precious few seconds before they came into the room? How would he use them if not to cry out? 
SHERLOCK, This little boy; this particular little boy ... (he looks at the bedside table and points towards it) ... who reads all of those spy books. What would he do? 
JOHN, He’d leave a sign? 
SHERLOCK, Linseed oil. 
ANDERSON, Not much use. Doesn’t lead us to the kidnapper. 
SHERLOCK," Brilliant, Anderson. "
ANDERSON, Really? 
SHERLOCK, Yes. Brilliant impression of an idiot. 
SHERLOCK, The floor. 
JOHN, He made a trail for us! 
SHERLOCK, The boy was made to walk ahead of them. 
SHERLOCK, Indicates anxiety; a gun held to his head. 
SHERLOCK," The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways. He had his left arm cradled about her neck. "
ANDERSON, That’s the end of it. We don’t know where they went from here. 
ANDERSON, Tells us nothing after all. 
SHERLOCK," You’re right, Anderson – nothing. "
JOHN, Having fun? 
SHERLOCK, Starting to. 
JOHN, Maybe don’t do the smiling. 
JOHN, Kidnapped children? 
JOHN, But how did he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked ... 
SHERLOCK, He walked in when they weren’t locked. 
JOHN, But a stranger can’t just walk into a school like that. 
SHERLOCK," Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment. Yesterday – end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff. What’s one more stranger among that lot? "
SHERLOCK, He was waiting for them. All he had to do was find a place to hide. 
SHERLOCK, Molly! 
MOLLY," Oh, hello. I’m just going out. "
MOLLY, I’ve got a lunch date. 
MOLLY, What? 
JOHN, It’s Moriarty? 
SHERLOCK, Course it’s Moriarty. 
MOLLY," Er, Jim actually wasn’t even my boyfriend. We went out three times. I ended it. "
SHERLOCK," Yes, and then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break at Pentonville. For the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly. "
SHERLOCK," Oil, John. "
SHERLOCK, The oil in the kidnapper’s footprint – it’ll lead us to Moriarty. 
SHERLOCK, All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved. The sole of the shoe is like a passport. If we’re lucky we can see everything that he’s been up to. 
SHERLOCK, I need that analysis. 
MOLLY, Alkaline. 
SHERLOCK," Thank you, John. "
MOLLY, Molly. 
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
 Sherlock has found the first component in the mixture of items and makes a note of it, 
 The results reveal another item, 
Dissolving another sample into a dish, 
And another sample dissolved and heated over a Bunsen burner, 
SHERLOCK, Glycerol molecule. 
 seeing it in his head as, 
SHERLOCK, What are you? 
MOLLY," What did you mean, “I owe you”? "
MOLLY," You said, “I owe you.” You were muttering it while you were working. "
MOLLY, You’re a bit like my dad. He’s dead. 
MOLLY," No, sorry. "
SHERLOCK," Molly, please don’t feel the need to make conversation. It’s really not your area. "
MOLLY," When he was ... dying, he was always cheerful; he was lovely – except when he thought no-one could see. I saw him once. He looked sad. "
MOLLY, You look sad ... (she glances towards John) ... when you think he can’t see you. 
MOLLY, Are you okay? 
MOLLY," And don’t just say you are, because I know what that means, looking sad when you think no-one can see you. "
SHERLOCK, But you can see me. 
MOLLY, I don’t count. 
MOLLY," What I’m trying to say is that, if there’s anything I can do, anything you need, anything at all, you can have me. "
MOLLY," No, I just mean ... I mean if there’s anything you need ... "
MOLLY, It’s fine. 
SHERLOCK, What-what-what could I need from you? 
MOLLY, I’m just gonna go and get some crisps. Do you want anything? 
MOLLY," It’s okay, I know you don’t. "
SHERLOCK," Well, actually, maybe I’ll ... "
MOLLY, I know you don’t. 
JOHN, Sherlock. 
SHERLOCK, Hmm? 
JOHN, This envelope that was in her trunk. There’s another one. 
SHERLOCK, What? 
JOHN, On our doorstep. Found it today. 
JOHN," Yes, and look at that. "
JOHN, Look at that. Exactly the same seal. 
SHERLOCK, Breadcrumbs. 
JOHN, Uh-huh. It was there when I got back. 
SHERLOCK, A little trace of breadcrumbs; hardback copy of fairy tales. 
SHERLOCK, Two children led into the forest by a wicked father follow a little trail of breadcrumbs. 
JOHN, That’s “Hansel and Gretel.” What sort of kidnapper leaves clues? 
SHERLOCK, The sort that likes to boast; the sort that thinks it’s all a game. He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me ... 
JIM, All fairytales need a good old-fashioned villain. 
SHERLOCK, The fifth substance: it’s part of the tale. 
SHERLOCK, The witch’s house. 
JOHN, What? 
SHERLOCK, The glycerol molecule. 
The final element in the sample becomes clear to him, 
SHERLOCK, PGPR! 
JOHN, What’s that? 
LESTRADE, This fax arrived an hour ago. 
There is a large handwritten note on the paper saying, 
LESTRADE, What have you got for us? 
SHERLOCK, Need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect. 
LESTRADE," Chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation ... What the hell is this? Chocolate? "
SHERLOCK, I think we’re looking for a disused sweet factory. 
LESTRADE, We need to narrow that down. A sweet factory with asphalt? 
SHERLOCK, No. No-no-no. Too general. Need something more specific. Chalk; chalky clay – that’s a far thinner band of geology. 
LESTRADE, Brick dust? 
SHERLOCK, Building site. Bricks from the 1950s. 
SHERLOCK, I’ve got people out looking. 
LESTRADE, So have I. 
SHERLOCK, Homeless network – faster than the police. (He smiles snidely.) Far more relaxed about taking bribes. 
SHERLOCK, John. 
SHERLOCK, Rhododendron ponticum. It matches. 
SHERLOCK, Addlestone. 
LESTRADE, What? 
SHERLOCK, There’s a mile of disused factories between the river and the park. It matches everything. 
LESTRADE," Right, come on. "
LESTRADE, Come on! 
DONOVAN," You, look over there. Look everywhere. Okay, spread out, please. Spread out. "
SHERLOCK, This was alight moments ago. 
SHERLOCK, They’re still here. 
SHERLOCK, Sweet wrappers. What’s he been feeding you? 
SHERLOCK, Hansel and Gretel. 
SHERLOCK, Mercury. 
LESTRADE, What? 
SHERLOCK, The papers: they’re painted with mercury. 
SHERLOCK, Lethal. The more of the stuff they ate ... 
JOHN, It was killing them. 
SHERLOCK," But it’s not enough to kill them on its own. Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them. "
SHERLOCK, He didn’t need to be there for the execution. Murder by remote control. He could be a thousand miles away. 
SHERLOCK, Neat. 
DONOVAN, I’ve got you. Don’t worry. 
LESTRADE," Now, remember, she’s in shock and she’s just seven years old, so anything you can do to ... "
SHERLOCK, ... not be myself. 
LESTRADE, Yeah. Might be helpful. 
SHERLOCK," Claudette, I ... "
SHERLOCK," No-no, I know it’s been hard for you ... "
SHERLOCK," Claudette, listen to me ... "
LESTRADE, Out. Get out! 
JOHN, Makes no sense. 
LESTRADE, The kid’s traumatised. Something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper. 
JOHN, So what’s she said? 
DONOVAN, Hasn’t uttered another syllable. 
JOHN, And the boy? 
LESTRADE," No, he’s unconscious; still in intensive care. "
 Sherlock stares at the enormous letters that have been painted, 
LESTRADE," Well, don’t let it get to you. I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room! In fact, so do most people. "
LESTRADE, Come on. 
DONOVAN," Brilliant work you did, finding those kids from just a footprint. It’s really amazing. "
SHERLOCK, Thank you. 
JOHN, Ah. 
JOHN, You okay? 
SHERLOCK, Thinking. 
SHERLOCK, This is my cab. You get the next one. 
JOHN, Why? 
SHERLOCK, You might talk. 
LESTRADE, What the hell is this? Chocolate? 
SHERLOCK, I think we’re looking for a disused sweet factory. 
LESTRADE, Get out! 
LESTRADE, Problem? 
VOICEOVER, This is a stunning evening wear set from us here at London Taxi Shopping. 
VOICEOVER," As you can see, the set comprises of a beautiful ... "
JIM, Hullo. Are you ready for the story? This is the story of Sir Boast-a-lot. 
DONOVAN, The footprint. It’s all he has. A footprint. 
LESTRADE," Yeah, well, you know what he’s like – CSI Baker Street. "
DONOVAN," Well, our boys couldn’t have done it. "
LESTRADE," Well, that’s why we need him. He’s better. "
DONOVAN, That’s one explanation. 
LESTRADE, And what’s the other? 
JIM," Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the Round Table, but soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories about how brave he was and how many dragons he’d slain ... "
JIM, And soon they began to wonder ... 
JIM, ... ‘Are Sir Boast-a-lot’s stories even true?’ 
JIM," Oh, no. "
DONOVAN, And then the girl screams her head off when she sees him – a man she has never seen before ... unless she had seen him before. 
LESTRADE, Wh-what’s your point? 
DONOVAN, You know what my point is. You just don’t wanna think about it. 
LESTRADE," You’re not seriously suggesting he’s involved, are you? "
ANDERSON, I think we have to entertain the possibility. 
JIM, That wasn’t the final problem. 
JIM, The End. 
SHERLOCK, Stop the cab! Stop the cab! 
SHERLOCK, What was that? 
SHERLOCK, What was that? 
JIM, No charge. 
MAN, Look out! 
JOHN, Sherlock! 
JOHN, That ... it’s him. It’s him. Sulejmani or something. Mycroft showed me his file. He’s a big Albanian gangster lives two doors down from us. 
SHERLOCK, He died because I shook his hand. 
JOHN, What d’you mean? 
SHERLOCK, He saved my life but he couldn’t touch me. Why? 
SHERLOCK, Four assassins living right on our doorstep. They didn’t come here to kill me; they have to keep me alive. 
SHERLOCK," I’ve got something that all of them want, but if one of them approaches me ... "
JOHN, ... the others kill them before they can get it. 
SHERLOCK, All of the attention is focussed on me. There’s a surveillance web closing in on us right now. 
JOHN, So what have you got that’s so important? 
SHERLOCK, We need to ask about the dusting. 
SHERLOCK," Precise details: in the last week, what’s been cleaned? "
MRS HUDSON," Well, Tuesday I did your lino ... "
SHERLOCK," No, in here, this room. This is where we’ll find it – any break in the dust line. You can put back anything but dust. "
SHERLOCK, Dust is eloquent. 
SHERLOCK, Cameras. We’re being watched. 
MRS HUDSON, What? Cameras? (She cringes.) Here? I’m in my nightie! 
LESTRADE, What? 
LESTRADE, But you haven’t heard the question! 
SHERLOCK, You want to take me to the station. Just saving you the trouble of asking. 
LESTRADE, Sherlock ... 
LESTRADE, Yeah. 
SHERLOCK," Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan. Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping? Ah, Moriarty is smart. He planted that doubt in her head; that little nagging sensation. You’re going to have to be strong to resist. You can’t kill an idea, can you? Not once it’s made a home ... (he reaches forward and briefly places his index fingertip on Greg’s forehead between his eyes) ... there. "
LESTRADE, Will you come? 
s game," first the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. He wants to destroy me inch by inch. "
SHERLOCK," It is a game, Lestrade, and not one I’m willing to play. "
Memo to Benedict Cumberbatch, could you please not go into full cello-jaguar voice when I’m typing late at night and wearing headphones cranked up loud? It’s not good for my underwear. Kthxbai.] 
SHERLOCK, They’ll be deciding. 
JOHN, Deciding? 
SHERLOCK, Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me. 
JOHN, You think? 
SHERLOCK, Standard procedure. 
JOHN, Should have gone with him. People’ll think ... 
SHERLOCK, I don’t care what people think. 
JOHN," You’d care if they thought you were stupid, or wrong. "
SHERLOCK," No, that would just make them stupid or wrong. "
JOHN," Sherlock, I don’t want the world believing you’re ... "
SHERLOCK, That I am what? 
JOHN, A fraud. 
SHERLOCK, You’re worried they’re right. 
JOHN, What? 
SHERLOCK, You’re worried they’re right about me. 
JOHN, No. 
SHERLOCK, That’s why you’re so upset. You can’t even entertain the possibility that they might be right. You’re afraid that you’ve been taken in as well. 
SHERLOCK," Moriarty is playing with your mind too. (Furious, he slams his hand onto the table.) Can’t you see what’s going on? "
JOHN," No, I know you’re for real. "
SHERLOCK, A hundred percent? 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT, Sherlock Holmes? 
LESTRADE," Yes, sir. "
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT, That bloke that’s been in the press. 
LESTRADE, Mmm-hmm. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT, I thought he was some sort of private eye. 
LESTRADE, He is. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT, We’ve been consulting with him – that’s what you’re ... you’re telling me? 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT," Not used him on any proper cases, though, have we? "
LESTRADE," Well, one or two. "
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT, What? 
LESTRADE," Look, I’m not the only senior officer who did this. Gregson ... "
LESTRADE," With all due respect, sir ... "
LESTRADE, Are you proud of yourselves? 
ANDERSON," Well, what if it’s not just this case? What if he’s done this to us every single time? "
JOHN," So, still got some friends on the Force. It’s Lestrade. Says they’re all coming over here right now, queuing up to slap on the handcuffs: every single officer you ever made feel like a tit, which is a lot of people. "
MRS HUDSON," Oh, sorry, am I interrupting? "
MRS HUDSON, Some chap delivered a parcel. I forgot. Marked ‘Perishable’ – I had to sign for it. 
MRS HUDSON," Funny name. German, like the fairytales. "
SHERLOCK, Burnt to a crisp. 
VOICE, Police! 
MRS HUDSON, I’ll go. 
LESTRADE," Sherlock Holmes, I’m arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping. "
JOHN, He’s not resisting. 
SHERLOCK," It’s all right, John. "
JOHN," He’s not resisting. No, it’s not all right. This is ridiculous. "
JOHN, You done? 
JOHN, Mmm-hmm? 
DONOVAN, First time we met. 
JOHN, Don’t bother. 
DONOVAN," “Solving crimes won’t be enough. One day he’ll cross the line.” Now, ask yourself: what sort of man would kidnap those kids just so he can impress us all by finding them? "
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT, Donovan. 
DONOVAN, Sir. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT, Got our man? 
DONOVAN," Er, yes, sir. "
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT," Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me. "
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT," Often are, these vigilante types. "
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT, What are you looking at? 
POLICE OFFICER," Are you all right, sir? "
SHERLOCK, Joining me? 
JOHN, Yeah. Apparently it’s against the law to chin the Chief Superintendant. 
JOHN, Huh. No-one to bail us. 
SHERLOCK, I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape. 
RADIO DISPATCHER, All units to two-seven. 
JOHN, What? 
RADIO DISPATCHER, All units to two ... 
SHERLOCK," Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees? "
SHERLOCK, NOW would be good! 
LESTRADE, Do as he says! 
JOHN, So what now? 
SHERLOCK, Doing what Moriarty wants – I’m becoming a fugitive. Run. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT," Get after him, Lestrade! "
SHERLOCK, Take my hand. 
JOHN, The gun! 
SHERLOCK, Leave it! 
JOHN," Sherlock, wait! "
SHERLOCK, Go to your right. 
JOHN, Huh? 
SHERLOCK, Go to your right. 
SHERLOCK," Everybody wants to believe it – that’s what makes it so clever. (He looks at John.) A lie that’s preferable to the truth. (Looking away again, his voice becomes bitter.) All my brilliant deductions were just a sham. No-one feels inadequate – Sherlock Holmes is just an ordinary man. "
JOHN, What about Mycroft? He could help us. 
SHERLOCK, A big family reconciliation? Now’s not really the moment. 
JOHN, Sher... Sherlock. 
JOHN, We’re being followed. I knew we couldn’t outrun the police. 
SHERLOCK, That’s not the police. It’s one of my new neighbours from Baker Street. Let’s see if he can give us some answers. 
JOHN, Where are we going? 
SHERLOCK, We’re going to jump in front of that bus. 
JOHN, What?! 
SHERLOCK, Tell me what you want from me. 
SHERLOCK, Tell me. 
ASSASSIN, He left it at your flat. 
SHERLOCK, Who? 
ASSASSIN, Moriarty. 
SHERLOCK, What? 
ASSASSIN, The computer keycode. 
SHERLOCK, Of course. He’s selling it – the programme he used to break into the Tower. He planted it when he came around. 
SHERLOCK, It’s a game-changer. It’s a key – it can break into any system and it’s sitting in our flat right now. That’s why he left that message telling everyone where to come. “Get Sherlock.” We need to get back into the flat and search. 
JOHN, CID’ll be camped out. Why plant it on you? 
SHERLOCK, It’s another subtle way of smearing my name. Now I’m best pals with all those criminals. 
JOHN," Yeah, well, have you seen this? "
JOHN, A kiss and tell. Some bloke called Rich Brook. 
JOHN, Who is he? 
SHERLOCK, Too late to go on the record? 
SHERLOCK, The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo(!) 
KITTY," I gave you your opportunity. I wanted to be on your side, remember? You turned me down, so ... "
SHERLOCK," And then, behold, someone turns up and spills all the beans. How utterly convenient. Who is Brook? "
SHERLOCK," Oh, come on, Kitty. No-one trusts the voice at the end of a telephone. "
SHERLOCK, There are all those furtive little meetings in cafés; those sessions in the hotel room where he gabbled into your dictaphone. How do you know that you can trust him? A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets. (Sternly) What were his credentials? 
JIM," Darling, they didn’t have any ground coffee so I just got normal ... "
KITTY," You are safe, Richard. I’m a witness. He wouldn’t harm you in front of witnesses. "
KITTY, Of course he’s Richard Brook. There is no Moriarty. There never has been. 
JOHN, What are you talking about? 
KITTY, Look him up. Rich Brook – an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty. 
JIM," Doctor Watson, I know you’re a good man. "
JIM, Don’t ... don’t h... Don’t hurt me. 
JOHN," No, you are Moriarty! (He turns his head briefly and yells at Kitty.) He’s Moriarty! (He turns back to Jim.) We’ve met, remember? You were gonna blow me up! "
JIM," I’m sorry. I’m sorry. (He gestures towards Sherlock.) He paid me. I needed the work. I’m an actor. I was out of work. I’m sorry, okay? "
JOHN," Sherlock, you’d better ... explain ... because I am not getting this. "
KITTY, Oh I’ll ... I’ll be doing the explaining – in print. (She hands John a folder.) It’s all here – conclusive proof. 
KITTY," Mmm-hmm. Invented all the crimes, actually – and to cap it all, you made up a master villain. "
JOHN," Oh, don’t be ridiculous! "
KITTY," Ask him. He’s right here! Just ask him. Tell him, Richard. "
KITTY, Yes ... (she points at Sherlock) ... and you paid him; paid him to take the rap. Promised you’d rig the jury. 
KITTY," Not exactly a West End role, but I’ll bet the money was good. "
KITTY, But not so good he didn’t want to sell his story. 
JIM, I am sorry. I am. I am sorry. 
 The big conclusion of it all, Moriarty’s an actor?! 
JIM," He knows I am. I have proof. I have proof. Show him, Kitty! Show him something! "
JOHN," Yeah, show me something. "
JIM, I’m ... I’m The Storyteller. It’s on DVD. 
JIM, Just tell him. It’s all coming out now. It’s all over. (His voice becomes more frantic.) Just tell them. Just tell them. Tell him! 
JIM, It’s all over now ... NO! 
JIM, Don’t you touch me! Don’t you lay a finger on me! 
JIM, Don’t hurt me! 
JOHN, Don’t let him get away! 
KITTY, Leave him alone! 
SHERLOCK," No, no, no. He’ll have back-up. "
KITTY," D’you know what, Sherlock Holmes? I look at you now and I can read you. "
KITTY, And you ... repel ... me. 
JOHN, Can he do that? Completely change his identity; make you the criminal? 
SHERLOCK, He’s got my whole life story. That’s what you do when you sell a big lie; you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable. 
JOHN, Your word against his. 
SHERLOCK," He’s been sowing doubt into people’s minds for the last twenty-four hours. There’s only one thing he needs to do to complete his game, and that’s to ... "
JOHN, Sherlock? 
SHERLOCK, Something I need to do. 
JOHN, What? Can I help? 
SHERLOCK, No – on my own. 
SHERLOCK," You’re wrong, you know. "
SHERLOCK, You do count. You’ve always counted and I’ve always trusted you. 
SHERLOCK, But you were right. I’m not okay. 
MOLLY, Tell me what’s wrong. 
MOLLY, What do you need? 
MOLLY, What do you need? 
SHERLOCK, You. 
JOHN," She has really done her homework, Miss Riley – things that only someone close to Sherlock could know. "
JOHN," Have you seen your brother’s address book lately? Two names: yours and mine, and Moriarty didn’t get this stuff from me. "
MYCROFT, John ... 
JOHN," So how does it work, then, your relationship? D’you go out for a coffee now and then, eh, you and Jim? "
JOHN," Your own brother, and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac. "
MYCROFT, I never inten... I never dreamt ... 
t it," “Watch his back, ’cause I’ve made a mistake.” "
JOHN, How did you meet him? 
MYCROFT," People like him: we know about them; we watch them. But James Moriarty ... the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen, and in his pocket the ultimate weapon: a keycode. A few lines of computer code that could unlock any door. "
JOHN, And you abducted him to try and find the keycode? 
MYCROFT, Interrogated him for weeks. 
JOHN, And? 
MYCROFT, He wouldn’t play along. 
MYCROFT," He just sat there, staring into the darkness. "
MYCROFT, The only thing that made him open up ... 
MYCROFT, I could get him to talk ... 
MYCROFT," ... just a little, but ... "
JOHN, ... in return you had to offer him Sherlock’s life story. So one big lie – Sherlock’s a fraud – but people will swallow it because the rest of it’s true. 
JOHN," Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right? And you have given him the perfect ammunition. "
MYCROFT, John ... 
MYCROFT," Tell him, would you? "
JOHN, Got your message. 
SHERLOCK," The computer code is key to this. If we find it, we can use it – beat Moriarty at his own game. "
JOHN," What d’you mean, “use it”? "
SHERLOCK," He used it to create a false identity, so we can use it to break into the records and destroy Richard Brook. "
JOHN, And bring back Jim Moriarty again. 
JOHN, Uh-huh. 
JOHN, What did he touch? 
SHERLOCK, An apple. Nothing else. 
JOHN, Did he write anything down? 
SHERLOCK, No. 
 takes his phone out of his pocket and begins to type a text message, 
 then adds, 
JOHN," Yeah, speaking. "
JOHN," What happened? Is she okay? (He listens.) Oh my God. Right, yes, I’m coming. "
SHERLOCK, What is it? 
JOHN, Paramedics. Mrs Hudson – she’s been shot. 
SHERLOCK, What? How? 
JOHN, Busy? 
SHERLOCK, Thinking. I need to think. 
JOHN, You need to ...? Doesn’t she mean anything to you? You once half killed a man because he laid a finger on her. 
JOHN, You machine. 
JOHN," Sod this. Sod this. (He heads towards the door.) You stay here if you want, on your own. "
SHERLOCK, Alone is what I have. Alone protects me. 
 He reaches into his pocket and looks at the message, 
JIM," Ah. Here we are at last – you and me, Sherlock, and our problem – the final problem. "
JIM," Stayin’ alive! It’s so boring, isn’t it? "
JIM, It’s just ... (he holds his hand out flat with the palm down and skims it slowly through the air level to the roof) ... staying. 
JIM, All my life I’ve been searching for distractions. You were the best distraction and now I don’t even have you. Because I’ve beaten you. 
JIM, And you know what? In the end it was easy. 
JIM, Ah well. 
JIM, Did you almost start to wonder if I was real? Did I nearly get you? 
SHERLOCK, Richard Brook. 
JIM," Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do. "
SHERLOCK, Of course. 
JIM, Attaboy. 
SHERLOCK, Rich Brook in German is Reichen Bach – the case that made my name. 
JIM, Good. You got that too. 
SHERLOCK, Beats like digits. 
SHERLOCK, Every beat is a one; every rest is a zero. Binary code. That’s why all those assassins tried to save my life. It was hidden on me; hidden inside my head – a few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system. 
JIM, I told all my clients: last one to Sherlock is a sissy. 
JIM," No, no, no, no, no, this is too easy. "
JIM, This is too easy. 
JIM," There is no key, DOOFUS! "
JIM, Those digits are meaningless. They’re utterly meaningless. 
JIM, You don’t really think a couple of lines of computer code are gonna crash the world around our ears? I’m disappointed. 
JIM," I’m disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock. "
SHERLOCK, But the rhythm ... 
JIM," “Partita number one.” Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach. "
SHERLOCK, But then how did ... 
JIM, Daylight robbery. All it takes is some willing participants. 
 He lifts his own phone to see the message," “it’s showtime !” then types on his keyboard and the alarms begin to sound as the security screens go blank. He gets up from the desk and hurries off, presumably to close the security door that will shut Jim into the Crown Jewels display room.) "
JIM," I knew you’d fall for it. That’s your weakness – you always want everything to be clever. Now, shall we finish the game? One final act. Glad you chose a tall building – nice way to do it. "
SHERLOCK, Do it? Do – do what? 
SHERLOCK," Yes, of course. My suicide. "
JIM," “Genius detective proved to be a fraud.” I read it in the paper, so it must be true. I love newspapers. Fairytales. "
JIM, And pretty Grimm ones too. 
MRS HUDSON," Oh, God, John! You made me jump! "
MRS HUDSON," Is everything okay now with the police? Has, um, Sherlock sorted it all out? "
JOHN, Taxi! 
JOHN, Taxi! 
JOHN," No, no, no, no, police! ... Sort of. "
SHERLOCK, I can still prove that you created an entirely false identity. 
JIM, Go on. For me. 
JIM, Pleeeeeease? 
SHERLOCK, You’re insane. 
JIM, You’re just getting that now? 
JIM," Okay, let me give you a little extra incentive. "
JIM, Your friends will die if you don’t. 
SHERLOCK, John. 
JIM, Not just John. (In a whisper) Everyone. 
SHERLOCK, Mrs Hudson. 
SHERLOCK, Lestrade. 
JIM, Three bullets; three gunmen; three victims. There’s no stopping them now. 
JIM, Unless my people see you jump. 
JIM, You can have me arrested; you can torture me; you can do anything you like with me; but nothing’s gonna prevent them from pulling the trigger. Your only three friends in the world will die ... unless ... 
SHERLOCK, ... unless I kill myself – complete your story. 
JIM, You’ve gotta admit that’s sexier. 
JIM," Oh, you’ve got an audience now. Off you pop. "
JIM, Go on. 
JIM, I told you how this ends. 
SHERLOCK," Would you give me ... one moment, please; one moment of privacy? "
SHERLOCK, Please? 
JIM, Of course. 
JIM, What? 
SHERLOCK," “You’re not going to do it.” So the killers can be called off, then – there’s a recall code or a word or a number. "
SHERLOCK, I don’t have to die ... (his voice becomes sing-song) ... if I’ve got you. 
JIM, Oh! (He laughs in relieved delight.) You think you can make me stop the order? You think you can make me do that? 
JIM," Sherlock, your big brother and all the King’s horses couldn’t make me do a thing I didn’t want to. "
JIM, Naah. You talk big. Naah. You’re ordinary. You’re ordinary – you’re on the side of the angels. 
JIM," No, you’re not. "
JIM, You’re me! Thank you! 
JIM, Sherlock Holmes. 
JIM," As long as I’m alive, you can save your friends; you’ve got a way out. "
JIM," Well, good luck with that. "
JOHN, Hello? 
SHERLOCK, John. 
JOHN," Hey, Sherlock, you okay? "
SHERLOCK, Turn around and walk back the way you came now. 
JOHN," No, I’m coming in. "
SHERLOCK, Stop there. 
SHERLOCK," Okay, look up. I’m on the rooftop. "
JOHN, Oh God. 
SHERLOCK," I ... I ... I can’t come down, so we’ll ... we’ll just have to do it like this. "
SHERLOCK, An apology. It’s all true. 
JOHN, Wh-what? 
SHERLOCK, Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty. 
JOHN, Why are you saying this? 
SHERLOCK, I’m a fake. 
JOHN, Sherlock ... 
JOHN," Okay, shut up, Sherlock, shut up. The first time we met ... the first time we met, you knew all about my sister, right? "
SHERLOCK, Nobody could be that clever. 
JOHN, You could. 
SHERLOCK, I researched you. Before we met I discovered everything that I could to impress you. (He sniffs quietly.) It’s a trick. Just a magic trick. 
JOHN," No. All right, stop it now. "
JOHN, All right. 
SHERLOCK," Keep your eyes fixed on me. (His voice becomes frantic.) Please, will you do this for me? "
JOHN, Do what? 
SHERLOCK," This phone call – it’s, er ... it’s my note. It’s what people do, don’t they – leave a note? "
JOHN, Leave a note when? 
SHERLOCK," Goodbye, John. "
JOHN, No. SHERLOCK! 
JOHN, Sher... 
JOHN," I’m a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please. "
JOHN," No, he’s my friend. He’s my friend. Please. "
JOHN," Nggh, Jesus, no. "
JOHN," God, no. "
ELLA, There’s stuff that you wanted to say ... 
ELLA, ... but didn’t say it. 
ELLA, Say it now. 
MRS HUDSON," There’s all the stuff, all the science equipment. I left it all in boxes. I don’t know what needs doing. I thought I’d take it to a school. "
MRS HUDSON, Would you ...? 
JOHN, I can’t go back to the flat again – not at the moment. 
JOHN, I’m angry. 
MRS HUDSON," It’s okay, John. There’s nothing unusual in that. That’s the way he made everyone feel. "
MRS HUDSON, All the marks on my table; and the noise – firing guns at half past one in the morning! 
JOHN, Yeah. 
MRS HUDSON, Bloody specimens in my fridge. Imagine – keeping bodies where there’s food! 
JOHN, Yes. 
MRS HUDSON, And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings-on! 
JOHN," Yeah, listen: I-I’m not actually that angry, okay? "
MRS HUDSON, Okay. 
MRS HUDSON," I’ll leave you alone to, erm ... (her voice breaks again) ... you know. "
 but let me tell you this," you were the best man, and the most human ... human being that I’ve ever known and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, and so ... There. "
JOHN," I was so alone, and I owe you so much. "
JOHN, Okay. 
JOHN," No, please, there’s just one more thing, mate, one more thing: one more miracle, Sherlock, for me. Don’t ... be ... (his voice breaks and fills with tears) ... dead. Would you do ...? Just for me, just stop it. (He gestures down at the grave.) Stop this. "
WOMAN, You bastard!
LESTRADE, A breakaway sect of Buddhist warrior monks infiltrated by a blonde drug smuggler?! That never really happened!
ANDERSON, A-A blonde drug smuggler who was exposed by an abbot with unusual powers of observation and deduction!
LESTRADE, A blonde woman hiding amongst bald monks? That wouldn’t exactly take Sherlock Holmes!
ANDERSON," Well, perhaps it did."
LESTRADE, He’s dead.
LESTRADE," I’m sorry. I wish he wasn’t, but he really is dead and gone."
ANDERSON," Well, how d’you explain this?"
ANDERSON, Sighting number two: Incident at New Delhi.
LESTRADE, You haven’t been titling these?
 INSPECTOR PRAKESH," After that it was simply a matter of tracking down the killer, which I did by working out the depth to which the chocolate Flake had sunk into the victim’s ice-cream cone. (He chuckles contentedly as the photographers and reporters crowd closer to the table.)  Shortly afterwards he leaves the room while the photographers continue trying to get one last picture. Closing the door behind him, he turns and looks at someone waiting a little way down the corridor. PRAKESH: My friend! (He looks over his shoulder as if to make sure that nobody is looking through the round glass window in the door, then turns back to the person in front of him.) PRAKESH: Will you not take any of the credit? This was all down to you. (We see who he’s looking at. A very familiar shape with curly hair and wearing a greatcoat is standing facing him. His face is obscured in shadow.)  THE PRESENT. PUB. LESTRADE: Clever man, Inspector Prakesh. ANDERSON: Oh, for ...! What police inspector could have made that deduction? LESTRADE: Oh, thank you(!) ANDERSON: You remember how Sherlock never took the credit when he solved all of your cases? LESTRADE (indignantly): He didn’t solve all of my cases! ANDERSON (gazing thoughtfully into the distance): He’s out there. He’s hiding. But he can’t stop himself from getting involved. (He chuckles.) ANDERSON: It’s so obviously him, if you know how to spot the signs! LESTRADE: The Klein Brothers, the Tower House thing, the Kensington Ripper – I solved all those myself! ANDERSON: Well, you got Tower House wrong. LESTRADE: No I didn’t! ANDERSON: Yep, you did. (He folds the map to another location.) ANDERSON: Okay, sighting number three ... (he taps Hamburg on the map) ... the Mysterious Juror. (Greg literally head-desks, leaning forward and thumping his forehead down onto the table.)  FLASHBACK. HAMBURG. In a jury room, the male foreman rubs his head tiredly before addressing the rest of the jury in German. FOREMAN: Nun, wie wir alle wissen, wurde diese Jury unter höchst ungewöhnlichen Umständen zusammengerufen. Aber ich muss Sie jetzt auf ein Urteil drängen. Ist Herr Trephoff schuldig oder nicht schuldig am Mord seiner Frau?  [Translation as subtitled: As we all know this jury was convened under highly unusual circumstances, but now I must press you for a judgment. Is Herr Trepoff guilty or not guilty of the murder of his wife?] (One by one, the jurors answer in German.) FEMALE JUROR 1: Nicht schuldig. [Not guilty.] (At the end of the table, the fingers of a male juror wearing a shirt and dark coat drum impatiently on the table.) FEMALE JUROR 2: Nicht schuldig. MALE JUROR 1: Nicht schuldig. (The juror’s fingers continue to drum ...) MALE JUROR 2: Nicht schuldig. (... and drum ...) FEMALE JUROR 3: Nicht schuldig. MALE JUROR 3: Nicht schuldig. MALE JUROR 4: Nicht schuldig. (... and drum ...) FEMALE JUROR 4: Nicht schuldig. MALE JUROR 5: Nicht schuldig. FEMALE JUROR 5: Nicht schuldig. (... and drum ... and then stop above the table. The foreman sighs wearily and looks at the last juror.) FOREMAN (in an exasperated voice): Nun? [Well?] (We see part of the juror from behind. He has dark curly hair and is wearing a dark greatcoat with the collar popped.)  Some time later, a man walks across a concourse towards to a display of newspapers. The “CAM Global News” front page headline reads “Trepoff ‘Guilty’ Sensation!” while a German newspaper beside it reads “TREPOFF SCHULDIG!” [Trepoff guilty!]   THE PRESENT. PUB. ANDERSON: It had to be him! There’s no-one else it can be! Do you not see? LESTRADE: I see that you lost a good job fantasising about a dead man coming back to life, and I know why you want that to happen. (He grimaces.) But it’s never gonna. (Anderson shakes his head.) LESTRADE: Okay ... (he finishes his pint) ... I’m gonna go and see an old friend. (He picks up his coat and looks across to Anderson.) LESTRADE: You take care, okay? (He stands and picks up a white box from a nearby stool, then looks down at his former colleague sympathetically.) LESTRADE: I’ll put a word in – see if they won’t review your case. ANDERSON: Just look at the map, though. (An imaginary dotted line works its way from New Delhi to Hamburg and then on to Amsterdam, and then Brussels.) ANDERSON: He’s getting closer. (He looks up at Greg.) ANDERSON: It’s like he’s coming back. (Greg looks thoughtful for a minute, then nods politely to Anderson and leaves the pub.)  JOHN WATSON’S HOME. John walks across the living room of his flat or house and puts the white box down on top of a filing cabinet. He turns and smiles at Greg. JOHN: It’s good to see you, Greg. LESTRADE: And you. (They shake hands.) JOHN: Have a seat. LESTRADE (sitting down in an armchair): So, how’ve you been? JOHN (sitting down on the sofa): Er, yeah, good. Yeah. Much better. (Greg nods. John points towards the box.) JOHN: Er, so what’s in the, er ...? LESTRADE: Oh, that, yeah. That’s, er, that’s some stuff from my office – some stuff of Sherlock’s, actually. I probably should have thrown it out, but I didn’t know if ... (He looks awkwardly at John.) JOHN: No, fine, yeah. (He smiles at Greg, who stands up and walks over to the box, smiling.) LESTRADE: Yeah, there’s-there’s-there’s something here. Um, wasn’t sure whether I should have kept it in. (He takes off the lid. Inside the box are a pink iPhone – perhaps the pink phone – together with a box of nicotine patches, a small sheet of paper with some writing on it, a toy train engine, a yellow mask of a face and a DVD in a case. He takes out the DVD.) LESTRADE: You remember the video message he made for your birthday? (John nods.) LESTRADE: Oh, I had to practically threaten him. (John smiles a little.) LESTRADE: This is the uncut version. It’s quite funny. (Smiling, he hands the DVD to John.) JOHN: Oh, right. (He takes it and looks at it.) LESTRADE: Maybe I shouldn’t have brought it. JOHN: Don’t worry. It’s okay. Probably won’t even watch it. (They smile awkwardly at each other, then John looks down at the DVD again.)  LATER. Greg has gone. John is sitting in the armchair pouring himself a glass of whisky. Screwing the lid back onto the bottle, he stands up and puts it into a nearby cupboard, then sits down again, picks up the glass and takes a drink. Gazing at the DVD on the table in front of him for a while, he eventually picks it up, looks thoughtfully across to the TV, then gets up and walks across the room to put the disc into the player. It loads and he walks back to get his glass. On the TV screen is the very familiar sight of the sofa in 221B Baker Street, with the smiley face sprayed on the wall behind it. John sits down on the sofa opposite the TV and takes another drink. SHERLOCK’s VOICE: Was that supposed to happen – the light going down? Yeah, okay. (On the TV screen, Sherlock paces across the living room in front of the sofa.) SHERLOCK: Oh, er, mmm. So, what do I, what do I, what d’you want me to do at the end? (He stops and looks at Greg who is presumably behind the camera.) SHERLOCK: Shall I, um ...? Smile and wink. I do that sometimes. I’ve no idea why. People seem to like it – humanises me. (He turns away.) LESTRADE: Fine. Whatever. SHERLOCK (turning back around): Why am I doing this, again? LESTRADE: You’re gonna miss the dinner. SHERLOCK: Of course I’m gonna miss dinner. There’ll be people. (He starts to turn away, then turns back.) SHERLOCK: How can John be having a birthday dinner? All his friends hate him. (John smiles very briefly.) SHERLOCK: You only have to look at their faces. I wrote an essay on suppressed hatred in close proximity based entirely on his friends. (John smiles again. Sherlock looks away thoughtfully.) SHERLOCK: On reflection, it probably wasn’t a very good choice of gift. (He pulls himself together and looks into the camera for a moment before looking past it to Greg.) SHERLOCK: What was my excuse again? LESTRADE: You said you had a thing. SHERLOCK: Ah, right, yes! That’s right. A thing. LESTRADE: You might wanna elaborate. SHERLOCK: No, no, no. Only lies have detail. (John closes his eyes and shakes his head minutely. Sherlock stares intensely into the camera for a couple of seconds.) SHERLOCK: Right, I just ... I need a moment to, um, figure out what I’m going to do. (He walks offscreen towards the window. John looks down at his glass.) JOHN: I can tell you what you can do. You can stop being dead. (He drinks.) SHERLOCK: Okay. (He was momentarily back in front of the camera and looking straight into it while he said that. John looks at the screen, startled, but Sherlock has already walked away again.) SHERLOCK: Okay, I’m ready now. (He sits down in his armchair, settles into it, then looks into the camera.) SHERLOCK: Hallo, John. (He smiles.) I’m sorry I’m not there at the moment. I’m very busy. However, many happy returns. (John looks at the screen, his face hard to read.) SHERLOCK: Oh, and don’t worry. I’m going to be with you again very soon. (John’s doorbell rings. He looks round, then sits forward, putting his glass on the table and pressing the Pause button on the remote control. The picture freezes on Sherlock looking intensely into the camera. John stands up and walks out of the room.)  ANDERSON: He’s coming back. (In the pub, he looks up and smiles to himself, then laughs quietly and looks down at the map, chuckling with delight.)  Greg is walking along a road, intermittently looking down at his phone, but then stops and stares at a man with a white beard standing nearby. The man is reading a copy of the Daily Express and the back page of the newspaper is facing towards Greg. It shows three footballers in the middle of a match, and the headline reads, “THE GAME IS BACK ON!” Greg stares at the headline for a few seconds, then smiles cynically and walks into a nearby shop.  Back in John’s living room, the Pause button shifts to Play on its own. Sherlock smiles widely into the camera and winks.  "
SHERLOCK, It’s a trick. Just a magic trick.
JOHN," No. All right, stop it now."
SHERLOCK," No, stay exactly where you are."
SHERLOCK, Don’t move.
JOHN, All right.
SHERLOCK," Keep your eyes fixed on me. Please, will you do this for me?"
JOHN, Do what?
SHERLOCK, This phone call – it’s ... it’s my note.
SHERLOCK," It’s what people do, don’t they? Leave a note?"
JOHN, Leave a note when?
SHERLOCK," Goodbye, John."
JOHN, No. Don’t.
DERREN, John.
DERREN, John. Look at me. Look at me.
DERREN, And sleep!
DERREN," Right the way down, right the way deep, right the way sound asleep. That’s right. That’s good – keeping my voice just there in the centre of your head and floating all the way around you."
DERREN," And you will awaken in three, two, one ..."
DERREN, ... zero.
ANDERSON, No-no-no-no! It’s obvious! That’s how he did it! It’s obvious!
LESTRADE, Derren Brown?! Let it go. Sherlock’s dead.
ANDERSON, Is he?
LESTRADE, There was a body. It was him. It was definitely him. Molly Hooper laid him out.
ANDERSON," No, she’s lying. It was Jim Moriarty’s body with a mask on!"
LESTRADE, A mask?!
LESTRADE," A bungee rope, a mask, Derren Brown. Two years, and the theories keep getting more stupid. How many more’ve you got for me today?"
ANDERSON," Well, you know the paving slabs in that whole area – even the exact ones that he landed on – you know they were all ..."
LESTRADE," You did this, and it killed him, and he’s staying dead. Do you honestly believe that if you have enough stupid theories, it’s gonna change what really happened?"
ANDERSON, I believe in Sherlock Holmes.
LESTRADE," Yeah, well that won’t bring him back."
LESTRADE, Well then. (He raises his cup.) Absent friends. Sherlock.
LESTRADE, And may God rest his soul.
MYCROFT," Now listen to me. There’s an underground terrorist network active in London and a massive attack is imminent. Sorry, but the holiday is over, brother dear."
MYCROFT," Back to Baker Street, Sherlock Holmes."
BOY, Penny for the guy?
BOY," Oi, mate! Penny for the guy?"
SECOND BOY," Penny for the guy, mate?"
FIRST BOY, Penny for the guy?
JOHN, That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.
SHERLOCK, And you invaded Afghanistan!
MYCROFT," You have been busy, haven’t you?"
MYCROFT, Quite the busy little bee. (He chuckles.)
SHERLOCK, Moriarty’s network – took me two years to dismantle it.
MYCROFT, And you’re confident you have?
SHERLOCK, The Serbian side was the last piece of the puzzle.
MYCROFT, Yes. You got yourself in deep there ... (he checks his report) ... with Baron Maupertuis. Quite a scheme.
SHERLOCK, Colossal.
SHERLOCK, Hmm.
MYCROFT, A small ‘thank you’ wouldn’t go amiss.
SHERLOCK, What for?
MYCROFT, For wading in.
MYCROFT," In case you’d forgotten, fieldwork is not my natural milieu."
SHERLOCK, “Wading in”? You sat there and watched me being beaten to a pulp.
SHERLOCK, No – I got me out. Why didn’t you intervene sooner?
MYCROFT," Well, I couldn’t risk giving myself away, could I? It would have ruined everything."
MYCROFT, Nonsense.
SHERLOCK, Definitely enjoying it.
 Listen," do you have any idea what it was like, Sherlock, going ‘under cover,’ smuggling my way into their ranks like that? (He grimaces.) The noise; the people."
SHERLOCK, I didn’t know you spoke Serbian.
MYCROFT," I didn’t, but the language has a Slavic root, frequent Turkish and German loan words. (He shrugs.) Took me a couple of hours."
SHERLOCK, Hmm – you’re slipping.
MRS HUDSON," Oh no – you don’t take it, do you?"
JOHN, No.
MRS HUDSON, You forget a little thing like that.
JOHN, Yes.
JOHN, Uh-huh.
MRS HUDSON, Not sure about that.
MRS HUDSON, Ages you.
JOHN, Just trying it out.
MRS HUDSON," Well, it ages you."
JOHN, Look ...
MRS HUDSON, I’m not your mother. I’ve no right to expect it ...
JOHN, No ...
MRS HUDSON," ... but just one phone call, John."
MRS HUDSON, Just one phone call would have done.
JOHN, I know.
MRS HUDSON, After all we went through.
JOHN," I just let it slide, Mrs Hudson. I let it all slide. And it just got harder and harder to pick up the phone somehow."
JOHN, D’you know what I mean?
MYCROFT," I need you to give this matter your full attention, Sherlock. Is that quite clear?"
SHERLOCK, What do you think of this shirt?
SHERLOCK," I will find your underground terror cell, Mycroft."
SHERLOCK," Just put me back in London. I need to get to know the place again, breathe it in – feel every quiver of its beating heart."
ANTHEA," One of our men died getting this information. All the chatter, all the traffic, concurs there’s going to be a terror strike on London – a big one."
MYCROFT, John?
SHERLOCK, Mmm. Have you seen him?
MYCROFT," Oh, yes – we meet up every Friday for fish and chips(!)"
MYCROFT," I’ve kept a weather eye on him, of course."
MYCROFT," You haven’t been in touch at all, to prepare him?"
SHERLOCK," Well, we’ll have to get rid of that."
MYCROFT, “We”?
SHERLOCK, He looks ancient. I can’t be seen to be wandering around with an old man.
MRS HUDSON, I couldn’t face letting it out.
MRS HUDSON, He never liked me dusting.
MRS HUDSON," So, why now? What changed your mind?"
JOHN," Well, I’ve got some news."
MRS HUDSON," Oh, God. Is it serious?"
JOHN," What? No – no, I’m not ill. I’ve, er, well, I’m ... moving on."
JOHN," Nope. Er, no – I’ve, er ... I’ve met someone."
MRS HUDSON," Oh, lovely!"
JOHN," Well, yes."
MRS HUDSON, What’s his name?
MRS HUDSON, A woman?!
JOHN," Yes, of course it’s a woman."
MRS HUDSON," You really have moved on, haven’t you?"
JOHN, Mrs Hudson! How many times ...? Sherlock was not my boyfriend.
 Listen to me, I am not gay!
SHERLOCK, Hmm. I’ll pop into Baker Street. Who knows – jump out of a cake.
MYCROFT, Why would he be? It’s been two years. He’s got on with his life.
SHERLOCK, What life? I’ve been away.
SHERLOCK, Where’s he going to be tonight?
MYCROFT, How would I know?
SHERLOCK, You always know.
MYCROFT, He has a dinner reservation in the Marylebone Road. Nice little spot. They have a few bottles of the 2000 Saint-Emilion ... though I prefer the 2001.
SHERLOCK, I think maybe I’ll just drop by.
MYCROFT," You know, it is just possible that you won’t be welcome."
SHERLOCK," No it isn’t. Now, where is it?"
MYCROFT, Where’s what?
SHERLOCK, You know what.
ANTHEA," Welcome back, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK, Your wife just texted you. Possibly her contractions have started.
WAITRESS," ’Scuse me, sir."
SHERLOCK," Sorry! I’m so, so sorry!"
SHERLOCK," Please, let me just go to the kitchen and, er, dry that off for you."
SHERLOCK," Finished with that, sir? Allow me to take it for you."
SHERLOCK," Madam, can I suggest you look at this menu? It’s, er, completely identical."
SHERLOCK," Can I ’elp you with anything, sir?"
JOHN," Er, it’s not really my area. What do you suggest?"
JOHN, Mm-hm.
JOHN," Great. I’ll have that one, please. "
JOHN," Well, er, surprise me."
MARY, Sorry that took so long.
MARY, You okay?
JOHN," Yeah, yeah. Me? Fine. I am fine."
MARY," Now then, what did you want to ask me?"
JOHN, More wine?
MARY," No, I’m good with water, thanks."
JOHN, Right. (He briefly looks away.)
MARY, So ...
JOHN," Er, so ... Mary. Listen, erm ... I know it hasn’t been long ... I mean, I know we haven’t known each other for a long time ..."
JOHN," Yes, I will. As you know, these last couple of years haven’t been easy for me; and meeting you ..."
JOHN," Yeah, meeting you has been the best thing that could have possibly happened."
MARY, I agree.
JOHN, What?
MARY, Sorry.
JOHN," Well, no. That’s, um ..."
JOHN," So ... if you’ll have me, Mary, could you see your way, um ..."
JOHN, ... if you could see your way to ...
JOHN," No, look, seriously ... (he finally lifts his gaze to meet the waiter’s eyes) ... could you just ..."
SHERLOCK, ... Not Dead.
SHERLOCK," Bit mean, springing it on you like that, I know. Could have given you a heart attack, probably still will. But in my defence, it was very funny."
SHERLOCK," Okay, it’s not a great defence."
MARY, Oh no! You’re ...
SHERLOCK, Not quite.
MARY, You died. You jumped off a roof.
SHERLOCK, No.
SHERLOCK, No. I’m quite sure. I checked. Excuse me.
MARY," Oh my God, oh my God. Do you have any idea what you’ve done to him?"
MARY," All right, just ... John? Just keep ..."
JOHN, I thought ...
JOHN, I thought ... you were dead. (His face begins to fill with anger again.) Hmm?
JOHN," Now, you let me grieve, hmm? How could you do that?"
SHERLOCK," ... um, one question. Just let me ask one question. Um ..."
SHERLOCK, I calculated that there were thirteen possibilities once I’d invited Moriarty onto the roof.
SHERLOCK, What?
SHERLOCK, Oh. ‘Why’ as in ...
SHERLOCK, I see. Yes. ‘Why?’ That’s a little more difficult to explain.
JOHN," Oh, so it’s your brother’s plan?"
MARY, Sorry.
JOHN, But he was the only one? The only one who knew?
SHERLOCK, Couple of others. 
SHERLOCK, It was a very elaborate plan – it had to be. The next of the thirteen possibilities ...
JOHN, Who else knew? 
JOHN, Who?
SHERLOCK, Molly.
SHERLOCK," Molly Hooper – and some of my homeless network, and that’s all."
JOHN," Okay. (He sits up a little and glances round at Mary, who gives him a sympathetic smile. He turns to Sherlock again.) Okay. So just your brother, and Molly Hooper, and a hundred tramps."
SHERLOCK, No! Twenty-five at most.
SHERLOCK," Seriously, it’s not a joke? (He gestures to his own top lip.) You’re-you’re really keeping this?"
JOHN, Yeah.
SHERLOCK, You’re sure?
JOHN, Mary likes it.
SHERLOCK," Mmmmmm, no she doesn’t."
JOHN, She does.
SHERLOCK, She doesn’t.
JOHN, Oh! (He tries to cover his moustache with his hand.) Brilliant.
MARY," I’m sorry. Oh, I’m sorry – I didn’t know how to tell you."
JOHN," No, no, this is charming(!)"
JOHN, I’ve really missed this(!)
JOHN," One Word, Sherlock. That is all I would have needed. One word to let me know that you were alive."
SHERLOCK," ... I worried that, you know, you might say something indiscreet."
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK," Well, you know, let the cat out of the bag."
MARY," Oh, God!"
SHERLOCK, Over-reacting.
MARY, John!
SHERLOCK, Shh!
JOHN, ... and you waltz in ’ere large as bloody life ...
SHERLOCK, Shh!
SHERLOCK," London is in danger, John. There’s an imminent terrorist attack and I need your help."
JOHN, My help?
SHERLOCK," You have missed this. Admit it. The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins, just the two of us against the rest of the world ..."
SHERLOCK, I don’t understand.
SHERLOCK, I said I’m sorry. Isn’t that what you’re supposed to do?
MARY," Gosh. You don’t know anything about human nature, do you?"
SHERLOCK," Mmm, nature? No. Human? ... No."
MARY, I’ll talk him round.
SHERLOCK, You will?
JOHN, Mary.
JOHN, Can you believe his nerve?
MARY, I like him.
JOHN, What?
LESTRADE," Ooh, you bastard!"
LESTRADE, Greg!
SHERLOCK, Greg.
RADIO," ... with an anti-terrorism bill this important, the government feels duty-bound to push through the legislation with all due expe..."
SHERLOCK, Don’t move. Keep your eyes fixed on me.
SHERLOCK," Please, will you do this for me? Please."
JOHN, Do what?
SHERLOCK," This phone call – it’s my note. That’s what people do, don’t they? Leave a note."
JOHN, Sherlock!
JIM, Oh-ho!
LAURA, I don’t see why not. It’s just as plausible as some of your theories.
ANDERSON," Look, if you’re not going to take it seriously, Laura, you can ... (He makes a ‘get out’ gesture.)"
ANDERSON," I founded ‘The Empty Hearse’ so like-minded people could meet, discuss theories ..."
ANDERSON, Sherlock’s still out there.
ANDERSON, I’m convinced of it.
LAURA, Oh my God.
LAURA, Oh. My. God!
MARY, “I couldn’t help thinking what an amazing criminal he’d make if he turned his talents against the law.”
JOHN, Don’t read that.
JOHN, Come on – that’s ...
MARY," ... ancient history, yes, I know. But it’s not, though, is it, because he’s ..."
JOHN, Having a wash.
JOHN," Well, you hate it."
MARY, Sherlock hates it.
JOHN, Apparently everyone hates it.
MARY, Are you gonna see him again?
JOHN, No – I’m going to work.
MARY," Oh. And after work, are you gonna see him again?"
MARY," Cor, I dunno – six months of bristly kisses for me, and then His Nibs turns up ..."
MARY, Oh! You should put that on a T-shirt!
JOHN, Shut up.
JOHN, Or I’ll marry you.
MYCROFT," All very interesting, Sherlock, but the terror alert has been raised to Critical."
SHERLOCK, Boring. Your move.
MYCROFT, We have solid information. An attack is coming.
SHERLOCK," “Solid information.” A secret terrorist organisation’s planning an attack – that’s what secret terrorist organisations do, isn’t it? It’s their version of golf."
MYCROFT, An agent gave his life to tell us that.
SHERLOCK," Oh, well, perhaps he shouldn’t have done. He was obviously just trying to show off."
MYCROFT, None of these markers of yours is behaving in any way suspiciously? (He glances down again and we hear him makes a move.) Your move.
SHERLOCK," No, Mycroft, but you have to trust me. I’ll find the answer. It’ll be in an odd phrase in an online blog, or an unexpected trip to the countryside, or a misplaced Lonely Hearts ad."
SHERLOCK, Your move.
MYCROFT, I’ve given the Prime Minister my personal assurance you’re on the case.
SHERLOCK, I am on the case. We’re both on the case. Look at us right now.
MYCROFT," Oh, bugger!"
SHERLOCK, Oopsie!
MYCROFT, Don’t be smart.
SHERLOCK," That takes me back. (In a little boy’s voice) “Don’t be smart, Sherlock. I’m the smart one.”"
SHERLOCK, I used to think I was an idiot.
MYCROFT," Both of us thought you were an idiot, Sherlock. We had nothing else to go on ’til we met other children."
SHERLOCK," Oh, yes. That was a mistake."
MYCROFT, Ghastly. What were they thinking of?
SHERLOCK, Probably something about trying to make friends.
MYCROFT," Oh yes. Friends. Of course, you go in for that sort of thing now."
MYCROFT," If you seem slow to me, Sherlock, can you imagine what real people are like? I’m living in a world of goldfish."
SHERLOCK," Yes, but I’ve been away for two years."
MYCROFT, So?
SHERLOCK," Rest assured, Mycroft – whatever this underground network of yours is up to, the secret will reside in something seemingly insignificant or bizarre."
MYCROFT, Speaking of which ...
MRS HUDSON," Oh, isn’t it wonderful, Mr Holmes?"
MYCROFT, I can barely contain myself(!)
SHERLOCK," Oh, he really can, you know."
MRS HUDSON, He’s secretly pleased to see you underneath all that ... (she pulls a sour face).
MYCROFT, Sorry – which of us?
MRS HUDSON, Both of you.
SHERLOCK, Let’s play something different.
SHERLOCK," Well, London’s terror alert has been raised to Critical. (He flails his legs over the table in front of him and stands up.) I’m just passing the time. Let’s do deductions."
SHERLOCK, Client left this while I was out. What d’you reckon?
SHERLOCK," Oh, go on. It’s been an age."
MYCROFT, I always win.
SHERLOCK, Which is why you can’t resist.
MYCROFT, Damn.
SHERLOCK," Isolated, too, don’t you think?"
MYCROFT, Why would he be isolated?
SHERLOCK, “He”?
MYCROFT, Obviously.
SHERLOCK, Why? Size of the hat?
MYCROFT, Don’t be silly. Some women have large heads too.
MYCROFT, No – he’s recently had his hair cut. You can see the little hairs adhering to the perspiration stains on the inside.
SHERLOCK," Some women have short hair, too."
MYCROFT, Balance of probability.
SHERLOCK," Not that you’ve ever spoken to a woman with short hair – or, you know, a woman."
MYCROFT," Stains show he’s out of condition, and he’s sentimental because the hat has been repaired three, four ..."
SHERLOCK," Five times. (He throws the hat back to his brother.) Very neatly. (Quick fire) The cost of the repairs exceeds the cost of the hat, so he's mawkishly attached to it, but it’s more than that. One, perhaps two, patches would indicate sentimentality, but five? Five’s excessive behaviour. Obsessive compulsive."
MYCROFT, Hardly. Your client left it behind. What sort of an obsessive compulsive would do that?
MYCROFT," The earlier patches are extensively sun-bleached, so he’s worn it abroad – in Peru."
SHERLOCK, Peru?
MYCROFT, This is a chullo – the classic headgear of the Andes. It’s made of alpaca.
MYCROFT, No?
SHERLOCK," Icelandic sheep wool. Similar, but very distinctive if you know what you’re looking for. I’ve written a blog on the varying tensile strengths of different natural fibres."
SHERLOCK, You said he was anxious.
MYCROFT," The bobble on the left side has been badly chewed, which shows he’s a man of a nervous disposition but ..."
MYCROFT, Precisely.
SHERLOCK, Brief sniff of the offending bobble tells us everything we need to know about the state of his breath.
MYCROFT, Elementary.
SHERLOCK, But you’ve missed his isolation.
MYCROFT, I don’t see it.
SHERLOCK, Plain as day.
MYCROFT, Where?
SHERLOCK, There for all to see.
MYCROFT, Tell me.
SHERLOCK, Plain as the nose on your ...
MYCROFT, Tell me.
MYCROFT, Not at all. Maybe he just doesn’t mind being different. He doesn’t necessarily have to be isolated.
SHERLOCK, Exactly.
MYCROFT, I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK, Why would anyone mind?
MYCROFT," ... I’m not lonely, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK, How would you know?
MYCROFT, Yes. Back to work if you don’t mind. Good morning.
MARY, Mr Summerson.
JOHN, Right.
MARY, Undescended testicle.
JOHN, ... Right.
MRS HUDSON, Sherlock.
MRS HUDSON, Talk to John.
SHERLOCK, I tried talking to him. He made his position quite clear.
JOHN," Just relax, Mr Summerson."
MRS HUDSON, What did he say?
SHERLOCK, F...
JOHN, Cough.
MRS HUDSON, Ooh dear!
JOHN, Hi.
JOHN, Right.
MOLLY, You wanted to see me?
SHERLOCK, Molly?
MOLLY, Yes?
SHERLOCK, Would you ...
SHERLOCK, Would you like to ...
MOLLY, ... have dinner?
JOHN," Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, Mrs Reeves. It’s very common ... (he turns and hands the prescription to her) ... but I’m recommending a course of ..."
SHERLOCK, ... monkey glands.
SHERLOCK," But enough about Professor Presbury. Tell us more about your case, Mr Harcourt."
MOLLY, Are you sure about this?
SHERLOCK, Absolutely.
MOLLY, Should I be making notes?
SHERLOCK, If it makes you feel better.
MOLLY," It’s just that that’s what John says he does, so if I’m being John ..."
MR HARCOURT," Well, absolutely no one should have been able to empty that bank account other than myself and Helen."
SHERLOCK, Why didn’t you assume it was your wife? 
MR HARCOURT, Because I’ve always had total faith in her.
SHERLOCK," No – it’s because you emptied it. (He points at the three areas on the man at which he had just looked and speaks rapidly.) Weight loss, hair dye, Botox; affair. (Whipping out a business card, he holds it out to Mrs Harcourt.) Lawyer. Next!"
MARY, This is Mr Blake. (Whispering) Piles.
JOHN," Mr Blake, hi."
SHERLOCK," And your pen pal’s emails just stopped, did they?"
SHERLOCK, Stepfather posing as online boyfriend.
SHERLOCK," Breaks it off, breaks her heart. She swears off relationships, stays at home – he still has her wage coming in."
SHERLOCK," Mr Windibank, you have been a complete and utter ..."
JOHN, ... piss pot.
JOHN," It’s nothing to worry about. Just a small infection by the sound of it. Er, Doctor Verner is your usual GP, yes?"
MR SZIKORA," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
MR SZIKORA," He looked after me, man and boy."
MR SZIKORA," I run a little shop, just on the corner of Church Street."
JOHN," Oh, right."
MR SZIKORA," “Tree Worshippers.” Oh, that’s a corker. It’s very saucy."
MR SZIKORA, “British Birds.” Same sort of thing.
JOHN," I’m fine, thanks."
JOHN, Jesus. Sherlock ...
MR SZIKORA, Huh?
JOHN, ... what do you want?
MR SZIKORA, Huh?
JOHN, Have you come to torment me?
MR SZIKORA, What are you talking about?
MR SZIKORA, Are you crazy?!
JOHN," It’s not as good as your French. Not as good as your French. It’s not even a good disguise, Sherlock!"
JOHN, Where’d you get it from? A bloody joke ... sh-shop ...?
JOHN, Oh my God.
JOHN, I am so sorry. Oh my God.
JOHN," Please for... (He looks across to Mary, speaking a little plaintively.) It’s fine."
LESTRADE, This one’s got us all baffled.
SHERLOCK, Mmm. I don’t doubt it.
MOLLY, What is it?
MOLLY," You’re on to something, aren’t you?"
SHERLOCK," Mm, maybe."
MOLLY, What?
SHERLOCK, Hmm? Nothing.
JOHN, Mmm.
MARY, You sure?
JOHN, I’m sure.
MARY, Okay. I’m late for Cath. I’ll see you later.
JOHN, ’Bye.
MARY, ’Bye.
SHERLOCK, Just giving it a go.
LESTRADE," Right. So, John?"
SHERLOCK, Not really in the picture any more.
MOLLY, Trains?
SHERLOCK, Trains.
MOLLY," Male, forty to fifty."
MOLLY," Ooh, sorry, did you want to be ...?"
SHERLOCK," Er, no, please. Be my guest."
MOLLY, Doesn’t make sense.
LESTRADE, What doesn’t?
MOLLY, This skeleton – it’s ... it can’t be any more than ...
MOLLY, Wow!
SHERLOCK, Hmm.
LESTRADE, “How I Did It” by Jack the Ripper?!
SHERLOCK, Mm-hm.
MOLLY, It’s impossible!
SHERLOCK, Welcome to my world.
SHERLOCK, I won’t insult your intelligence by explaining it to you.
LESTRADE," No, please – insult away!"
SHERLOCK, The-the-the corpse is-is six months old; it’s dressed in a shoddy Victorian outfit from a museum. It’s been displayed on a dummy for many years in a case facing south-east judging from the fading of the fabric. It was sold off in a fire-damage sale ... (he gets out his phone and shows the screen to Greg) ... a week ago.
LESTRADE, So the whole thing was a fake.
SHERLOCK, Yes.
LESTRADE, Looked so promising.
MOLLY, Why would someone go to all that trouble?
HOWARD, Oh. Thanks for hanging on to it.
SHERLOCK, No problem.
SHERLOCK," So, what’s this all about, Mr Shilcott?"
HOWARD, My girlfriend’s a big fan of yours.
SHERLOCK, Sorry. Do go on.
HOWARD, I like trains.
SHERLOCK, Yyyes.
HOWARD," I work on the Tube, on the District Line, and part of my job is to wipe the security footage after it’s been cleared."
HOWARD," I was just whizzing through and, er, I found something a bit bizarre."
HOWARD," Now, this was a week ago. The last train on the Friday night, Westminster station, and this man gets into the last car."
MOLLY, “Car”?
HOWARD," They’re cars, not carriages. It’s a legacy of the early American involvement in the Tube system."
SHERLOCK, He said he liked trains.
MOLLY, Hmm!
HOWARD, And the next stop ... (he shows the appropriate footage) ... St James’s Park station ... and ...
HOWARD, I thought you’d like it.
HOWARD," He gets into the last car at Westminster, the only passenger ..."
HOWARD," ... and the car is empty at St James’s Park station. Explain that, Mr Holmes."
MOLLY, Couldn’t he have just jumped off?
HOWARD," There’s a safety mechanism that prevents the doors from opening in transit. But there’s something else. The driver of that train hasn’t been to work since. According to his flatmate, he’s on holiday. Came into some money."
SHERLOCK," So if the driver of the train was in on it, then the passenger did get off."
HOWARD," There’s nowhere he could go. It’s a straight run on the District Line between the two stations. There’s no side tunnels, no maintenance tunnels – nothing on any map. Nothing. The train never stops, and the man vanishes. Good, innit?!"
SHERLOCK, I know that face.
MOLLY, Right.
MOLLY, What?
SHERLOCK, I know a fantastic fish shop just off the Marylebone Road. The owner always gives me extra portions.
SHERLOCK, No – I helped him put up some shelves.
MOLLY, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK, Hmm?
MOLLY, What was today about?
SHERLOCK, Saying thank you.
MOLLY, For what?
SHERLOCK, Everything you did for me.
MOLLY, It’s okay. It was my pleasure.
SHERLOCK," No, I mean it."
MOLLY," I don’t mean ‘pleasure.’ I mean, I didn’t mind. I wanted to."
SHERLOCK," But you can’t do this again, can you?"
MOLLY, I had a lovely day. I’d love to – I just ... um ... (She looks down.)
MOLLY, He’s not from work.
MOLLY," We met through friends, the old-fashioned way. He’s nice. We ... he’s got a dog ... we-we go to the pub on weekends and he ... I’ve met his mum and dad and his friends and all his family. I’ve no idea why I’m telling you this."
SHERLOCK," I hope you’ll be very happy, Molly Hooper. You deserve it. After all, not all the men you fall for can turn out to be sociopaths(!)"
MOLLY, No?
SHERLOCK, No.
MOLLY, Maybe it’s just my type.
MARY," Oh, Mrs Hudson."
MARY, Sorry – I-I think someone’s got John – John Watson.
MRS HUDSON, Hang on! Who are you?
SHERLOCK, Mary? What’s wrong?
SHERLOCK," First word, then every third. Save ... John ... Watson."
 leaving just the vital ones, 
MARY, Where are we going?
SHERLOCK, St James the Less. It’s a church. Twenty minutes by car.
SHERLOCK, Did you drive here?
MARY," Er, yes."
SHERLOCK, This.
MARY, What does it mean? What are they going to do to him?
SHERLOCK, I don’t know.
s shoulder so that he can see the latest message, 
POLICE OFFICER, Oi! Oi! You can’t go down there!
MAN," No. It’s not gonna work. Bit damp. I’ll get something to help it along, yeah?"
DAD, Eh?
MARY, What does it mean?
SHERLOCK, Oh my God.
JOHN, Help!
SHERLOCK, Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
SHERLOCK, John!
JOHN, Help!
SHERLOCK, John? John!
WOMAN," ... which wasn’t the way I’d put it at all. Silly woman. Anyway, it was then that I first noticed it was missing. I said, “Have you checked down the back of the sofa?”"
WOMAN," He’s always losing things down the back of the sofa, aren’t you, dear?"
MAN, ’Fraid so.
WOMAN," Keys, small change, sweeties. Especially his glasses."
MAN, Glasses.
WOMAN," Blooming things. I said, “Why don’t you get a chain – wear ’em round your neck?” And he says, “What – like Larry Grayson?”"
SHERLOCK," So did you find it eventually, your lottery ticket?"
WOMAN," Well, yes, thank goodness. We caught the coach on time after all. We managed to see, er, St Paul’s, the Tower ... but they weren’t letting anyone in to Parliament."
WOMAN, Some big debate going on.
SHERLOCK, John!
JOHN, Sorry – you’re busy.
WOMAN," Oh, were we?"
SHERLOCK, Yes. 
JOHN," No, no, if you’ve got a case ..."
SHERLOCK," No, not a case, no-no-no. (To the woman) Go. ’Bye."
WOMAN," Yeah, well, we’re here ’til Saturday, remember."
SHERLOCK," Yes, great, wonderful. Just get out."
WOMAN," Well, give us a ring."
SHERLOCK," Very nice, yes, good. Get out."
WOMAN, We’re just so pleased it’s all over.
MAN," Ring up more often, won’t you?"
MAN, She worries.
WOMAN, Promise?
SHERLOCK," Oh, for God..."
SHERLOCK, Sorry about that.
JOHN," No, it’s fine. Clients?"
JOHN, Your parents?
SHERLOCK, In town for a few days.
JOHN, Your parents?
SHERLOCK, Mycroft promised to take them to a matinee of “Les Mis.” Tried to talk me into doing it.
JOHN, Those were your parents?
SHERLOCK, Yes.
JOHN, Well ... (He chuckles briefly.) That is not what I ... 
SHERLOCK, What?
JOHN, I-I mean they’re just ... so ...
JOHN, ... ordinary.
SHERLOCK, It’s a cross I have to bear.
JOHN," Did they know, too?"
SHERLOCK, Hmm?
JOHN, That you spent the last two years playing hide and seek.
SHERLOCK, Maybe.
JOHN, Ah! So that’s why they weren’t at the funeral.
SHERLOCK," See you’ve shaved it off, then."
JOHN, Yeah. Wasn’t working for me.
SHERLOCK," Mm, I’m glad."
JOHN," What, you didn’t like it?"
JOHN, That’s not a sentence you hear every day!
SHERLOCK, How are you feeling?
JOHN," Yeah, not bad. Bit ... smoked."
SHERLOCK, Right.
JOHN, Last night – who did that? And why did they target me?
SHERLOCK, I don’t know.
JOHN, Is it someone trying to get to you through me? Is it something to do with this terrorist thing you talked about?
SHERLOCK, I don’t know. I can’t see the pattern. It’s too nebulous.
SHERLOCK, Why would an agent give his life to tell us something incredibly insignificant? That’s what’s strange.
JOHN, “Give his life”?
SHERLOCK, According to Mycroft. There’s an underground network planning an attack on London – that’s all we know.
SHERLOCK," These are my rats, John."
JOHN, Rats?
SHERLOCK," My markers: agents, low-lifes, people who might find themselves arrested or their diplomatic immunity suddenly rescinded. If one of them starts acting suspiciously, we know something’s up. Five of them are behaving perfectly normally, but the sixth ..."
SHERLOCK," Lord Moran, peer of the realm, Minister for Overseas Development. Pillar of the establishment."
JOHN, Yes!
SHERLOCK, He’s been working for North Korea since 1996.
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK, He’s the Big Rat. Rat Number One. And he’s just done something very suspicious indeed.
SHERLOCK, Not according to the maps.
JOHN, Mm.
SHERLOCK," There’s something – something, something I’m missing, something staring me in the face."
SHERLOCK, Our rat’s just come out of his den.
JOHN, Al-Qaeda; the IRA have been getting restless again – maybe they’re gonna make an appearance ...
JOHN, What?
JOHN, What are you on about?
SHERLOCK, Mycroft’s intelligence – it’s not nebulous at all. It’s specific – incredibly specific.
SHERLOCK," Not an underground network, John. It’s an Underground network."
JOHN, Right. ... What?
SHERLOCK," Sometimes a deception is so audacious, so outrageous that you can’t see it even when it’s staring you in the face."
SHERLOCK, Look – seven carriages leave Westminster ... (the footage switches to show the next station) ... but only six carriages arrive at St James’s Park.
JOHN, But that’s ... I ... it’s-it’s impossible.
SHERLOCK, Moran didn’t disappear – the entire Tube compartment did. The driver must have diverted the train and then detached the last carriage.
JOHN, Detached it where?! You said there was nothing between those stations.
SHERLOCK," Not on the maps, but once you eliminate all the other factors, the only thing remaining must be the truth. (He points at the screen.) That carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere."
JOHN," But why, though? Why detach it in the first place?"
JOHN, Hmm? November the ... My God.
SHERLOCK, Lord Moran – he’s a peer of the realm. Normally he’d sit in the House. Tonight there’s an all-night sitting to vote on the new anti-terrorism Bill.
SHERLOCK, But he won’t be there. Not tonight. (He turns to look down at John.) Not the fifth of November.
JOHN," “Remember, remember.”"
SHERLOCK, “Gunpowder treason and plot.”
HOWARD," There’s nothing down there, Mr Holmes, I told you. No sidings, no ghost stations."
JOHN," Look – this whole area is a big mess of old and new stuff. Charing Cross is made up of bits of older stations like Trafalgar Square, Strand ..."
SHERLOCK," No, it’s none of those. We’ve accounted for those."
SHERLOCK," St Margaret’s Street, Bridge Street, Sumatra Road, Parliament Street ..."
JOHN," Well, why isn’t it on the maps?"
HOWARD, ’Cause it was closed before it ever opened.
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK, It’s right underneath the Palace of Westminster.
JOHN, And so what’s down there? A bomb?
JOHN, Oh ...
JOHN," So it’s a bomb, then? A Tube carriage is carrying a bomb."
SHERLOCK, Must be.
JOHN, Right.
SHERLOCK, What are you doing?
JOHN, Calling the police.
SHERLOCK, What? No!
JOHN," Sherlock, this isn’t a game. They need to evacuate Parliament."
SHERLOCK," They’ll get in the way. They always do. This is cleaner, more efficient."
JOHN, And illegal.
SHERLOCK, A bit.
SHERLOCK, I don’t understand.
JOHN," Well, that’s a first!"
SHERLOCK, There’s nowhere else it could be.
SHERLOCK, Oh!
JOHN, Hang on. Sherlock?
JOHN, That’s ... Isn’t it live?
JOHN," ’Course, yeah(!) Avoid the rails. Great(!)"
SHERLOCK, This way.
JOHN, You sure?
SHERLOCK, Sure.
JOHN, Ah. Look at that.
SHERLOCK, John.
JOHN, Hmm?
JOHN, Demolition charges.
JOHN, It’s empty. There’s nothing.
SHERLOCK, Isn’t there?
SHERLOCK, This is the bomb.
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK, It’s not carrying explosives. The whole compartment is the bomb.
JOHN, We need bomb disposal.
SHERLOCK, There may not be time for that now.
JOHN, So what do we do?
SHERLOCK, Why d’you think I know what to do?
JOHN, Because you’re Sherlock Holmes. You’re as clever as it gets.
SHERLOCK, Doesn’t mean I know how to defuse a giant bomb. What about you?
JOHN, I wasn’t in bomb disposal. I’m a bloody doctor.
JOHN," Can’t-can’t we rip the timer off, or something?"
SHERLOCK, That would set it off.
JOHN, You see? You know things.
SHERLOCK, Er ...
SHERLOCK, Er ...
JOHN, Why didn’t you call the police?
SHERLOCK, Please just ...
SHERLOCK," Well, it’s no use now."
SHERLOCK," Go, John. (He points towards the driver’s cab.) Go now."
JOHN," There’s no point now, is there, because there’s not enough time to get away; and if we don’t do this ... (he gestures down to the mother bomb) ... other people will die!"
JOHN, Mind Palace.
SHERLOCK, Hmm?
JOHN, Use your Mind Palace.
SHERLOCK, How will that help?
JOHN, You’ve salted away every fact under the sun!
SHERLOCK," Oh, and you think I’ve just got “How To Defuse A Bomb” tucked away in there somewhere?"
JOHN, Yes!
SHERLOCK, Maybe.
JOHN, Think!
JOHN, Oh my God.
JOHN, This is it.
SHERLOCK," Um, er ..."
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK, Forgive me?
SHERLOCK, No.
JOHN, Another one of your bloody tricks.
SHERLOCK, No.
JOHN, You’re just trying to make me say something nice.
SHERLOCK, Not this time.
JOHN, It’s just to make you look good even though you behaved like ...
JOHN, I wanted you not to be dead.
SHERLOCK," Yeah, well, be careful what you wish for."
SHERLOCK," If I hadn’t come back, you wouldn’t be standing there and ..."
SHERLOCK, ... you’d still have a future ... with Mary.
JOHN," I find it difficult, this sort of stuff."
JOHN," Yes, of course I forgive you."
SHERLOCK, The criminal network Moriarty headed was vast.
JIM, You can have me arrested ...
JIM, ... you can torture me; you can do anything you like with me ...
JIM, ... but nothing’s gonna prevent them from pulling the trigger.
JIM, Your only three friends in the world will die ... unless ...
SHERLOCK, ... unless I kill myself – complete your story.
JIM, You’ve gotta admit that’s sexier.
SHERLOCK," No, stay exactly where you are. Don’t move."
SHERLOCK," Keep your eyes fixed on me. (His voice becomes frantic.) Please, will you do this for me?"
JOHN, SHERLOCK!
JOHN," Let me come through, please."
WOMAN, It’s all right ...
JOHN," No, he’s my friend."
WOMAN," It’s all right, it’s all right."
JOHN," No, he’s my friend."
JOHN," He’s my friend. Please, let me just check ..."
SHERLOCK, Everything was anticipated; every eventuality allowed for. It worked ... (he smiles slightly) ... perfectly.
ANDERSON, Molly? Molly Hooper? She was in on it?
SHERLOCK, Yes. You remember the little girl who was abducted by Moriarty?
LESTRADE, Get out!
SHERLOCK," You assumed she reacted like that because I was her kidnapper. But I deduced Moriarty must have found someone who looked very like me to plant suspicion, and that that man – whoever he was – had to be got out of the way as soon as his usefulness ended. That meant there was a corpse in a morgue somewhere that looked just like me."
ANDERSON, Clever.
SHERLOCK," Molly found the body, faked the records, and I provided the other coat. I’ve got lots of coats."
ANDERSON, And what about the sniper aiming at John?
SHERLOCK, Mycroft’s men intervened before he could take the shot. He was invited to reconsider.
MYCROFT, Is it done?
MYCROFT, Good.
ANDERSON, And your homeless network?
SHERLOCK," As I explained, the whole street was closed off ... (he smiles) ... like a scene from a play."
SHERLOCK," Neat, don’t you think?"
ANDERSON, Hmm.
SHERLOCK, What?
ANDERSON, Not the way I’d have done it.
ANDERSON," No, I’m not saying it’s not clever, but ..."
ANDERSON, ... Bit ... disappointed.
SHERLOCK," Everyone’s a critic. Anyway, that’s not why I came."
ANDERSON, No?
SHERLOCK," No. I think you know why I’m here, Phillip. “How I Did It” by Jack the Ripper?"
ANDERSON, Didn’t you think it was intriguing? (He looks up hopefully.)
ANDERSON," I just couldn’t live with myself, knowing that I’d driven you to ... (He stops.)"
SHERLOCK, But you didn’t. You were always right. I wasn’t dead.
SHERLOCK, Yeah.
ANDERSON," Oh, God, I’m sorry, Sherlock. I’m so sorry."
ANDERSON, That doesn’t make sense.
ANDERSON," How could you be sure John would stand on that exact spot? I mean, what if he’d moved?"
JOHN, You ...
JOHN, ... utter ...
SHERLOCK, Your face!
JOHN, You ...
SHERLOCK, I totally had you.
JOHN, You cock! I knew it! I knew it! You f...
JOHN, ... to anyone. You KNEW!
SHERLOCK, Ahh. (He squats down to the bomb.)
SHERLOCK, There’s an Off switch.
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK, There’s always an Off switch.
SHERLOCK, I didn’t lie altogether. I’ve absolutely no idea how to turn any of these silly little lights off.
SHERLOCK, Oh!
JOHN, And you did call the police.
SHERLOCK, ’Course I called the police.
JOHN, I’m definitely gonna kill you.
SHERLOCK," Oh, please(!) Killing me – that’s so two years ago."
s VOICE," Sherlock, please. I beg of you. You can take over at the interval."
JOHN, Come on. You’ll have to go down. They want the story.
SHERLOCK, In a minute.
MRS HUDSON," Oh, I’m really pleased, Mary. Have you set a date?"
MARY," Er, well we thought May."
MRS HUDSON, Oh! Spring wedding!
MARY," Yeah. Well, once we’ve actually got engaged."
JOHN, Yeah.
JOHN, Yeah.
LESTRADE," Well, I can’t wait."
MARY," You will be there, Sherlock?"
SHERLOCK, Weddings – not really my thing.
MOLLY," Hello, everyone."
JOHN," Hey, Molly."
MOLLY," Tom, this is everyone."
TOM, Hi.
LESTRADE, Hi.
TOM, It’s really nice to meet you all. (He looks at John.) Hi.
JOHN," Wow. Yeah, hi. I’m John. (He shakes his hand.) Good to meet you."
SHERLOCK, Ready?
JOHN, Ready.
MOLLY, Yes.
MOLLY, Thanks.
TOM, Thank you.
MRS HUDSON," Sit down, love."
TOM," Oh, thanks."
LESTRADE," So, um, is it serious, you two?"
JOHN," No, best not."
JOHN, I’m still waiting.
SHERLOCK, Hmm?
JOHN," Why did they try and kill me? If they knew you were on to them, why go after me – put me in the bonfire?"
SHERLOCK," Unlike the nicely embellished fictions on your blog, John, real life is rarely so neat."
SHERLOCK," I don’t know who was behind all this, but I will find out, I promise you."
JOHN, Don’t pretend you’re not enjoying this.
JOHN, Being back. Being a hero again.
SHERLOCK," Oh, don’t be stupid."
JOHN, You’d have to be an idiot not to see it. You love it.
JOHN, Being Sherlock Holmes.
SHERLOCK, I don’t even know what that’s supposed to mean.
JOHN," Sherlock, you are gonna tell me how you did it? How you jumped off that building and survived?"
JOHN," No, but seriously. When you were dead, I went to your grave."
SHERLOCK, I should hope so.
JOHN, I made a little speech. I actually spoke to you.
JOHN, I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead.
SHERLOCK," Anyway, time to go and be Sherlock Holmes."
LESTRADE, They just walked out of there!
DONOVAN," Yeah, I know. I was sort of sitting next to you."
LESTRADE, The whole Waters family! They just walked right out of there!
DONOVAN," Again, I was in the room."
DONOVAN, They’re good.
LESTRADE," They’re greedy, and they’ll do it again, and next time we’re gonna catch ’em in the act."
DONOVAN, How?
s note, some of the newspaper articles name Greg as ‘DCI Lestrade’ but in the end credits of the programme he is named as ‘DI Lestrade.’ I am far more inclined to believe the end credits.]
DONOVAN, No good?
LESTRADE, They always know we’re coming. (Furiously) How do they always know?
DONOVAN, They’re good. They work at it.
LESTRADE, They’re never gonna stop.
DONOVAN," Well, neither are we."
LESTRADE, You still blocking it?
DONOVAN, Yeah. Very efficiently hacked. They must be bloody pleased with themselves.
LESTRADE, They must be! (He smiles at her.)
LESTRADE, Right then?
DONOVAN," Oh, no! No, you’ve gotta make the arrest. This one’s yours, boss."
LESTRADE, You’ve never called me ‘boss’ before.
DONOVAN," Ah, well, look what happens when you’re good!"
LESTRADE, You know how most days aren’t good days? This is a good day.
DONOVAN, Not for the Waters family.
DONOVAN," Okay: ten men on the roof; all exits covered; the bank’s closed, so there are no hostages to worry about ..."
LESTRADE," Sorry, no, go on, go on."
DONOVAN," Um, we’ve got the tunnel entrance covered; and Davies, Willard and Christie are heading up our Response on Mafeking Road."
LESTRADE," Sorry, I’d better get this."
LESTRADE," I-I, I have to go."
LESTRADE, You make the arrest.
DONOVAN, No way!
LESTRADE, Sorry. You’ll be fine. I’m-I’m-I’m cool with this.
DONOVAN, Jones’ll get all the credit if you leave now! You know he will!
LESTRADE," Yeah, but d... It doesn’t matter. I have to go."
SHERLOCK, This is hard.
LESTRADE, What?
SHERLOCK, Really hard. Hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.
SHERLOCK, Have you any funny stories about John?
LESTRADE, What?!
SHERLOCK, I need anecdotes.
SHERLOCK," Didn’t go to any trouble, did you?"
SHERLOCK," Shut up, Mrs Hudson."
MRS HUDSON, I haven’t said a word.
MRS HUDSON, I thought it was you playing.
SHERLOCK, I am composing.
SHERLOCK, I was road-testing.
MRS HUDSON, You what?
MRS HUDSON, I’m bringing you your morning tea. (She pours some milk into the teacup.) You’re not usually awake.
SHERLOCK, I don’t know. I just thought it sort of happened.
MRS HUDSON, Your mother has a lot to answer for.
SHERLOCK," Mm, I know. I have a list. Mycroft has a file."
MRS HUDSON, The wedding! John and Mary getting married!
SHERLOCK," Two people who currently live together are about to attend church, have a party, go on a short holiday and then carry on living together. What’s big about that?"
MRS HUDSON," It changes people, marriage."
SHERLOCK," Mmm, no it doesn’t."
MRS HUDSON," Well, you wouldn’t understand ’cause you always live alone."
SHERLOCK, Your husband was executed for double murder. You’re hardly an advert for companionship. (He drinks.)
MRS HUDSON," Marriage changes you as a person, in ways that you can’t imagine."
SHERLOCK, As does lethal injection. (He smiles pointedly at her.)
MRS HUDSON," My best friend, Margaret – she was my chief bridesmaid."
MRS HUDSON," We were going to be best friends forever, we always said that; but I hardly saw her after that."
MRS HUDSON, I’ve run out. 
SHERLOCK, Have the shops?
MRS HUDSON," She cried the whole day, saying, “Ooh, it’s the end of an era.”"
MRS HUDSON," She was probably right, really."
MRS HUDSON," I remember she left early. I mean, who leaves a wedding early? (She shakes her head.) So sad."
SHERLOCK," Mmm. Anyway, you’ve got things to do."
MRS HUDSON," No, not really. I’ve got plenty of time to ..."
SHERLOCK, You can if you like. She understands very little.
SHERLOCK, Into battle.
PHOTOGRAPHER," Congratulations! Okay, hold it there – I wanna get this shot of the newlyweds."
PHOTOGRAPHER," Er, just the bride and groom, please."
JOHN, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK," Oh, sorry."
PHOTOGRAPHER," Okay – three, two, one, cheese!"
JANINE," The famous Mr Holmes! I’m very pleased to meet you. But no sex, okay?"
SHERLOCK, Is it?
SHERLOCK," If that’s the sort of thing you’re looking for ... (he jerks his head towards one of the wedding guests) ... the man over there in blue is your best bet. Recently divorced doctor with a ginger cat ... (there’s a close-up of a ginger cat hair stuck on the man’s suit, and the sound of a miaow) ... a barn conversion ... (close-up of sawdust on the man’s footwear) ... and a history of erectile dysfunction."
SHERLOCK," Reviewing that information, possibly not your best bet."
JANINE," Yeah, maybe not."
JANINE, Mr Holmes ... (she takes his arm) ... you’re going to be incredibly useful.
MARY, How are you?
MAN," You look beautiful, Mary."
MARY, Thank you!
MAN, Congratulations.
MARY, David!
DAVID," Mary. Congratulations. You look, um, very nice."
DAVID," John, congratulations. You’re a lucky man."
JOHN, Thank you.
MARY," Um, er, David, this is Sherlock."
DAVID," Um, yeah. We’ve, um, we’ve met."
DAVID," So, what exactly are my duties as an usher?"
SHERLOCK," Let’s talk about Mary, first."
DAVID," Sorry, what?"
SHERLOCK," Oh, I think you know what. You went out with her for two years."
DAVID, A-ages ago. We’re j... we’re just good friends now.
SHERLOCK, Is that a fact?
SHERLOCK," Whenever she tweets, you respond within five minutes regardless of time or current location, suggesting you have her on text alert. In all your Facebook photographs of the happy couple, Mary takes centre frame whereas John is always partly or entirely excluded."
SHERLOCK, You volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on on no less than three separate occasions. Do you have anything to say in your defence?
SHERLOCK, I have your contact details. I will be monitoring.
SHERLOCK, High-functioning sociopath ... with your number.
MARY, Hello!
MARY, Pleased to see you.
WOMAN, Congratulations.
JOHN," Thanks for coming, thank you."
MARY," Hello, Archie!"
SHERLOCK," Mm, yes, um, well done in the service, Archie."
MUM, He’s really come out of his shell. I don’t know how you did it.
SHERLOCK, Um ...
SHERLOCK," Basically it’s a cute smile to the bride’s side, cute smile to the groom’s side and then the rings."
SHERLOCK, And you have to wear the outfit.
SHERLOCK, You really do have to wear the outfit.
SHERLOCK, Grown-ups like that sort of thing.
SHERLOCK, ... I don’t know. I’ll ask one.
SHERLOCK, Yep. (He pops the ‘p’ loudly.)
ARCHIE, Have you solved any murders?
SHERLOCK, Sure. Loads.
ARCHIE, Can I see?
ARCHIE, What’s all the stuff in his eye?
SHERLOCK, Maggots.
ARCHIE, Cool!
MUM," He said you had some pictures for him, as a treat."
SHERLOCK," Er, yes ... (he pats Archie’s head) ... if he’s good."
MUM, Hmm? (She looks down at Archie as they go inside.) What did you say?
PHOTOGRAPHER, Nice.
JOHN," Oh, d’you want ...?"
MARY, Had to lose so much weight to get into this dress.
JANINE, He’s nice.
SHERLOCK," Traces of two leading brands of deodorant, both advertised for their strength, suggestive of a chronic body odour problem manifesting under stress."
JANINE," Okay, done there. What about his friend?"
SHERLOCK," Long-term relationship, compulsive cheat."
JANINE, Seriously?
SHERLOCK," Waterproof cover on his smartphone. (Close-up of the phone in the man’s jacket pocket.) Yet his complexion doesn’t indicate outdoor work. (Close-up of the man’s face.) Suggests he’s in the habit of taking his phone into the shower with him, which means he often receives texts and emails he’d rather went unseen."
SHERLOCK, D’you like solving crimes?
JANINE, Do you have a vacancy?
MARY," So, Harry?"
JOHN," Er, no. No show."
MARY," Darling, I’m so sorry."
JOHN," It was a bit of a punt asking her, I suppose. Still, free bar – wouldn’t have been a good mix."
JOHN," Oh, God, wow!"
MARY," Oh, G... Is that ...?"
JOHN, He came!
SHERLOCK, So that’s him. Major Sholto.
MARY, Uh-huh.
SHERLOCK," If they’re such good friends, why does he barely even mention him?"
MARY, He mentions him all the time to me. He never shuts up about him.
SHERLOCK, About him?
MARY, Mm-hmm.
MARY, Urgh. I chose this wine. It’s bloody awful.
SHERLOCK," Yes, but it’s definitely him that he talks about?"
MARY, Mm-hmm.
JOHN," I’m very, very glad to see you, sir. I know you don’t really do this sort of thing."
SHOLTO," Well, I do for old friends, Watson ... John. It’s good to see you."
JOHN, You too.
SHOLTO," Civilian life suiting you, then?"
JOHN," Er, er, yes, well ... (he gestures towards Mary) ... I think so, sir."
SHOLTO, No more need for the trick cyclist?
JOHN," No, I-I go now and then. Sort of a top-up."
JOHN, Therapy can be very helpful.
JOHN, Where are you living these days?
SHOLTO," Oh, way out in the middle of nowhere. You wouldn’t know it."
SHERLOCK, I’ve never even heard him say his name.
MARY," Well, he’s almost a recluse – you know, since ..."
SHERLOCK, Yes.
MARY, I didn’t think he’d show up at all. John says he’s the most unsociable man he’s ever met.
SHERLOCK, He is? He’s the most unsociable?
MARY, Mm.
SHERLOCK," Ah, that’s why he’s bouncing round him like a puppy."
MARY," Oh, Sherlock! Neither of us were the first, you know."
SHERLOCK, Stop smiling.
MYCROFT, Filing.
SHERLOCK, Either I’ve caught you in a compromising position or you’ve been working out again. I favour the latter.
MYCROFT, What do you want?
SHERLOCK," I need your answer, Mycroft, as a matter of urgency."
MYCROFT, “Answer”?
SHERLOCK," Even at the eleventh hour it’s not too late, you know."
SHERLOCK," Cars can be ordered, private jets commandeered."
MYCROFT," Today. It’s today, isn’t it? No, Sherlock, I will not be coming to the “night do,” as you so poetically put it."
MYCROFT, ... delighted not to have me hanging around.
SHERLOCK," Oh, I don’t know. There should always be a spectre at the feast."
SHERLOCK, What do you mean?
MYCROFT, Just like old times.
SHERLOCK," No, I don’t understand."
MYCROFT," Well, it’s the end of an era, isn’t it? John and Mary – domestic bliss."
SHERLOCK," No, no, no – I prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new chapter."
SHERLOCK, What?
MYCROFT, Nothing!
SHERLOCK, I know that silence. What?
MYCROFT," Well, I’d better let you get back to it. You have a big speech, or something, don’t you?"
MYCROFT," Cake, karaoke ... mingling."
MYCROFT," This is what people do, Sherlock – they get married. I warned you: don’t get involved."
SHERLOCK, Involved? I’m not involved.
SHERLOCK, John asked me to be his best man. How could I say no?
SHERLOCK, I’m not involved!
SHERLOCK, I will.
MYCROFT," Oh, by the way, Sherlock – do you remember Redbeard?"
SHERLOCK," I’m not a child any more, Mycroft."
MYCROFT," No, of course you’re not. Enjoy not getting involved, Sherlock."
MASTER OF CEREMONIES, Pray silence for the best man.
SHERLOCK," Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends ... and ... erm ... others."
SHERLOCK, Er ... w...
SHERLOCK, A-a-also ...
MOLLY, Greg.
LESTRADE, Molly.
LESTRADE, Is that a brain?!
MOLLY, What if John asks Sherlock to be his best man?
LESTRADE," Well, he will, won’t he? He’s bound to."
MOLLY, Exactly.
LESTRADE, So?
MOLLY, So he’ll have to make a speech in front of people.
MOLLY," There’ll be actual people there, actually listening."
MOLLY, Helen Louise probably wondered the same.
LESTRADE, Helen Louise?
MRS HUDSON," Oh, hallo, dear."
MRS HUDSON," What, the speech, dear? No, it’ll be fine."
MOLLY," It-it’s not just the speech, though, is it?"
JOHN, Mrs Hudson?
MRS HUDSON," Oh, hello, darling! (She continues to giggle.)"
JOHN, You all right?
JOHN," I was – I was coming to see Sherlock, and I thought you were ..."
JOHN, ... possibly dying. (He grins at the sight of her mirth.)
MRS HUDSON," Oh, sorry!"
JOHN, What’s wrong?
MRS HUDSON, The-the telegrams!
SHERLOCK," Right, um ..."
SHERLOCK, First things first. Telegrams.
JOHN," Ah, Mike."
MARY, Ahh!
JOHN, Yeah?
SHERLOCK, “... Oodles of love and heaps of good wishes from CAM.”
SHERLOCK, “Wish your family could have seen this.”
JOHN, Hey. Hmm?
SHERLOCK," When John first broached the subject of being best man, I was confused."
JOHN, Sherlock?
JOHN," Er, it was Mrs Hudson laughing."
SHERLOCK, Sounded like she was torturing an owl.
JOHN," Yeah. Well, it was laughter."
SHERLOCK, Could have been both.
SHERLOCK," Just occupying myself. (He lifts his head and looks dramatically towards the ceiling.) Sometimes, it’s so-o-o hard not smoking."
SHERLOCK, Oh.
JOHN, Mm-hmm. Mind if I interrupt?
SHERLOCK, Tea? 
JOHN, Er ... 
SHERLOCK, The best man?
JOHN, What do you think?
JOHN," Sorry, what?"
SHERLOCK," Oh, right."
JOHN, Maybe not a garrotter.
SHERLOCK, Gavin?
JOHN, Who?
SHERLOCK," Gavin Lestrade? He’s a man, and good at it."
JOHN, It’s Greg. And he’s not my best friend.
SHERLOCK," Oh, Mike Stamford, I see. Well, he’s nice, um, though I’m not sure how well he’d cope with all ..."
JOHN," Look, Sherlock, this is the biggest and most important day of my life."
JOHN," No, it is! It is, and I want to be up there with the two people that I love and care about most in the world."
SHERLOCK, Yes.
JOHN," So, Mary Morstan ..."
SHERLOCK, Yes.
JOHN, ... you.
SHERLOCK," I confess at first I didn’t realise he was asking me. When finally I understood, I expressed to him that I was both flattered and ... surprised."
SHERLOCK, I explained to him that I’d never expected this request and I was a little daunted in the face of it.
JOHN, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK," I nonetheless promised that I would do my very best to accomplish a task which was – for me – as demanding and difficult as any I had ever contemplated. Additionally, I thanked him for the trust he’d placed in me ..."
SHERLOCK," ... and indicated that I was, in some ways, very close to being ... moved by it."
JOHN, That’s getting a bit scary now.
SHERLOCK, It later transpired that I had said none of this out loud.
SHERLOCK," So, in fact ... "
SHERLOCK, You-you mean ...
JOHN, Yes.
SHERLOCK, I’m your ...
SHERLOCK, ... best ...
JOHN, ... man.
JOHN," Yeah, ’course you are. ’Course you’re my best friend."
JOHN," Well, how was that?"
SHERLOCK, Surprisingly okay.
JOHN," So you’ll have to make a speech, of course."
SHERLOCK, Done that. ... Done that ... Done that bit ... Done that bit ... Done that bit ... Hmm ...
SHERLOCK," I’m afraid, John, I can’t congratulate you."
SHERLOCK," Today we honour the death-watch beetle that is the doom of our society and, in time – one feels certain – our entire species."
SHERLOCK, But anyway ... (he looks down at his cards) ... let’s talk about John.
SHERLOCK," Indeed, any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes, in truth, from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides."
SHERLOCK," It is a fact, I believe, that brides tend to favour exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day. There is a certain analogy there, I feel."
SHERLOCK, ... or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot.
SHERLOCK," The point I’m trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet. "
SHERLOCK, I am dismissive of the virtuous ...
SHERLOCK, ... unaware of the beautiful ...
SHERLOCK," ... and uncomprehending in the face of the happy. So if I didn’t understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody’s best friend."
SHERLOCK, Certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.
SHERLOCK," John, I am a ridiculous man ..."
SHERLOCK," ... redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship. But, as I’m apparently your best friend, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion."
SHERLOCK," Actually, now I can."
SHERLOCK," Mary, when I say you deserve this man, it is the highest compliment of which I am capable. John, you have endured war, and injury, and tragic loss ... (he leans closer to John) ... so sorry again about that last one ... (he straightens up again) ... so know this: today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved – in short, the two people who love you most in all this world. And I know I speak for Mary as well when I say we will never let you down, and we have a lifetime ahead to prove that."
JOHN," If I try and hug him, stop me."
MARY, Certainly not. 
SHERLOCK," Ah, yes. Now on to some funny stories about John ..."
SHERLOCK, Did I do it wrong?
SHERLOCK, I haven’t finished yet.
JOHN," Yeah, I know, I know."
JOHN, Can you – can you wait ’til I sit down?
SHERLOCK," So, on to some funny stories about John."
SHERLOCK," If you could all just cheer up a bit, that would ..."
SHERLOCK," ... be better. On we go. So, for funny stories ... (he reaches into his pocket and takes out his phone) ... one has to look no further than John’s blog."
JOHN, Here we go.
SHERLOCK," The record of our time together. Of course, he does tend to romanticise things a bit, but then, you know ... (he looks down at John and Mary and half-winks at them) ... he’s a romantic. We’ve tackled some strange cases: the Hollow Client ..."
SHERLOCK, ... the Poison Giant ...
SHERLOCK, We’ve had some frustrating cases ...
JOHN, What is that?
SHERLOCK," A French decathlete found completely out of his mind, surrounded by one thousand, eight hundred and twelve matchboxes – all empty except this one."
JOHN, And what’s in that one?
JOHN, She’s going to ring the doorbell.
JOHN," Oh, no. She’s changed her mind."
JOHN," No, she’s gonna do it ... No, she’s leaving. She’s leaving. ... Oh, she’s coming back."
SHERLOCK, She’s a client. She’s boring. I’ve seen those symptoms before.
JOHN, Hmm?
SHERLOCK, Oscillation on the pavement always means there’s a love affair.
SHERLOCK, ... and of course I have to mention the elephant in the room.
SHERLOCK," But we want something ... very particular for this special day, don’t we?"
SHERLOCK, The Bloody Guardsman.
SHERLOCK," Need to work on your half of the church, Mary. Looking a bit thin."
SHERLOCK, Schedule the organ music to begin at precisely 11.48.
MARY, But the rehearsal’s not for another two weeks. Just calm down.
SHERLOCK, Calm? I am calm. I’m extremely calm.
MARY," Let’s get back to the reception, come on."
SHERLOCK," Second class post, cheap card ... (he sniffs it and grimaces) ... bought at a petrol station. Look at the stamp: three attempts at licking. She’s obviously unconsciously retaining saliva."
MARY, Ah. (Over her shoulder to John) Let’s stick her by the bogs.
s note, ‘bogs’ is a slang word for ‘toilets.’]
SHERLOCK, Oh yes.
MARY, Who else hates me?
MARY, Oh great – thanks(!)
SHERLOCK, Done.
MARY, Table five.
MARY," Oh, John’s old commanding officer. I don’t think he’s coming."
JOHN, He’ll be there.
MARY," Well, he needs to RSVP, then."
MARY, Mmm ...
SHERLOCK," Swan, or Sydney Opera House?"
MARY, Where’d you learn to do that?!
MARY," Fibbing, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK, I once broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact severity of ...
MARY, I’m not John. I can tell when you’re fibbing.
MARY," Opera House, please."
MARY," Ooh, hang on. I’m buzzing."
MARY, Hello?
MARY," Oh, hi, Beth!"
JOHN, He knows we don’t have a friend called Beth. He’s gonna figure out that it’s code.
MARY, He’s YouTube-ing serviettes.
JOHN, He’s thorough.
MARY, He’s terrified. 
JOHN, ’Course he’s not.
MARY," Right, you know when you’re scared of something, you start wishing it sooner just to get it all going? That’s what he’s doing."
JOHN, Why would he be scared that we’re getting married? It’s not gonna change anything – we’ll still do stuff.
MARY," Well, you need to prove it to him. I told you to find him a new case."
JOHN, I’m trying.
MARY," You need to run him, okay? Show him it’s still the good old days."
SHERLOCK, That just sort of ... happened.
JOHN," Sherlock, um ..."
JOHN, ... mate ...
JOHN, I-I’ve ...
JOHN, I’ve smelled eighteen different perfumes; I’ve sampled ... (he stops to think) ... nine different slices of cake which all tasted identical; I like the bridesmaids in purple ...
SHERLOCK, Lilac.
JOHN," ... lilac. Um, there are no more decisions left to make. I don’t even understand the decisions that we have made. I’m faking opinions and it’s exhausting, so please, before she comes back ..."
JOHN, ... pick something.
JOHN, Anything. Pick one.
SHERLOCK, Pick what?
JOHN, A case. Your Inbox is bursting. Just ... get me out of here.
JOHN," Please, Sherlock, for me."
SHERLOCK, Oh.
s note for the following scenes, my knowledge of military terminology is extremely limited. I have googled the heck out of certain terms in the hope of getting them right but am not confident that I am using the correct words all the time. I’m happy to take corrections from people with expertise. 
JOHN, It’s “sailor.”
JOHN, And Bainbridge thinks his stalker is a bloke.
JOHN, Let’s go and investigate. Please?
JOHN, Forty enlisted men and officers.
SHERLOCK, Why this particular Grenadier? Curious.
JOHN, Now you’re talking.
JOHN," Er, we’re just going to ... I need, um, Sherlock to help me choose some, er, socks."
JOHN, Yeah.
MARY," I mean, you’ve got to get the right ones."
JOHN, Exactly – to go with my ...
SHERLOCK, ... tie.
JOHN, My coat in there?
MARY, Yes!
MARY, I know.
SHERLOCK, Mm.
SHERLOCK, Coming.
SHERLOCK, Taxi!
PARADE SERGEANT," Company, halt! ... Right turn!"
JOHN, We’re here to see Private Stephen Bainbridge.
DUTY SERGEANT," He’s on duty right now, sir ... (he hands the wallet back) ... but I’ll certainly let him know when he’s free."
SHERLOCK, And when will that be?
DUTY SERGEANT, Another hour.
SHERLOCK, Do you think they give them classes?
JOHN, Classes?
SHERLOCK, How to resist the temptation to scratch their behinds?
JOHN, Afferent neurons in the peripheral nervous system.
JOHN, Bum itch.
SHERLOCK, Oh!
SHERLOCK, So why don’t you see him any more?
JOHN, Who?
SHERLOCK," Your previous commander, Sholto."
JOHN, “Previous commander.”
JOHN, “Previous” suggests that I currently have a commander.
SHERLOCK, Which you don’t.
JOHN, Which I don’t.
JOHN, Not to everyone. He led a team of crows into battle.
SHERLOCK, “Crows”?
JOHN, New recruits. It’s standard procedure; break the new boys in – but it went wrong. They all died; he was the only survivor. The press and the families gave him hell. He gets more death threats than you.
SHERLOCK," Oh, I wouldn’t count on that."
JOHN, Why have you suddenly taken an interest in another human being?
SHERLOCK, I’m ... chatting.
JOHN," Changing the subject completely ... (he pulls in a breath through his nose, then looks at Sherlock again) ... you know it won’t alter anything, right, me and Mary, getting married? We’ll still be doing all this."
SHERLOCK," Oh, good."
JOHN, If you were worrying.
SHERLOCK, Wasn’t worried.
JOHN," See, the thing about Mary – she has completely turned my life around; changed everything. But, for the record, over the last few years there are two people who have done that ... and the other one is ..."
JOHN, ... a complete dickhead.
REED, Can I ask what this is in connection with?
JOHN," Private Bainbridge contacted us about a personal matter, sir."
REED, Nothing’s personal when it concerns my troops. What do you really want?
JOHN, I’m here on a legitimate enquiry.
REED, Press? Digging for some bloody Royal story or something?
REED," Retired. You could be a used car salesman now, for all I know."
DUTY SERGEANT, Bainbridge! Gentleman here to see you!
DUTY SERGEANT, Bainbridge!
REED," I know you, don’t I?"
JOHN, Hmm?
REED, I’ve seen you in the papers.
REED, Hang around with that detective – the one with the silly hat. What the hell does Bainbridge want with a detective?
JOHN, I’m afraid I’m not at liberty to say.
REED, You’re not at liberty to say?! He’s a soldier in my regiment – I’ll be damned if he’s going to get up to cloak and dagger nonsense like this.
DUTY SERGEANT, Sir ...
DUTY SERGEANT, Sir.
REED, What’s going on?
DUTY SERGEANT," It’s Bainbridge, sir. He’s dead."
REED, My God!
JOHN," Ah, no, let me take a look, sir. I’m a doctor."
REED," What? Sergeant, arrest this man."
JOHN, What? No-no! I’m a – I’m a doctor.
REED," Oh, you’re a doctor now, too. Sergeant ..."
JOHN," Let me examine him, please!"
SERGEANT," Sir, caught this one snooping around."
REED, Is that what this was all about? Distracting me so that this man could get in here and kill Bainbridge?
JOHN, Don’t be ...
REED, What?
SHERLOCK," Where’s the weapon? Go on, search me. (He holds his arms wide.) No weapon."
JOHN, Bainbridge was on parade. He came off duty five minutes ago. When’s this supposed to have happened?
SHERLOCK, No.
REED, No?!
SHERLOCK, He’s soaking wet and there’s still shampoo in his hair. He got into the shower and then someone stabbed him.
DUTY SERGEANT," The cubicle was locked from the inside, sir. I had to break it open."
REED, You must have climbed over the top.
SHERLOCK," Well then I’d be soaking wet too, wouldn’t I?"
DUTY SERGEANT, Suicide?
SHERLOCK, No. The weapon again – no knife.
JOHN, Hmm. There is a wound to the abdomen – incredibly fine.
SHERLOCK, Man stabbed to death. No murder weapon. Door locked from the inside. Only one way in or out of here.
JOHN, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK, Mmm?
JOHN, He’s still breathing.
DUTY SERGEANT, Oh my God.
JOHN, Give me your scarf.
SHERLOCK, What?
JOHN," Quickly, now."
JOHN, Call an ambulance.
SERGEANT, What?
JOHN," Nurse, press here – hard."
JOHN," Yeah, I’m making do. Keep pressure on that wound."
JOHN," Stephen. Stephen, stay with me."
SHERLOCK," Private Bainbridge had just come off guard duty. He’d stood there for hours, plenty of people watching, nothing apparently wrong. He came off duty and within minutes was nearly dead from a wound in his stomach, but there was no weapon. Where did it go? Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to consider this: a murderer who can walk through walls, a weapon that can vanish – but in all of this there is only one element which can be said to be truly remarkable. Would anyone like to make a guess?"
SHERLOCK," Come on, come on, there is actually an element of Q and A to all of this."
SHERLOCK, Scotland Yard.
SHERLOCK, Have you got a theory?
SHERLOCK," Yeah, you. You’re a detective – broadly speaking. Got a theory?"
LESTRADE," Er, um, if the, uh, if the, if-if-if, if the blade was, er, propelled through the, um ... (he stops to think for a moment) ... grating in the air vent ... maybe a-a ballista or a – or a – or a catapult. Erm, somebody tiny could-could crawl in there. (He sucks in a breath.) So, yeah, we’re loo... we’re looking for a-a-a-a dwarf."
SHERLOCK, Brilliant.
LESTRADE, Really?
SHERLOCK, Next!
SHERLOCK, Hello? Who was that?
SHERLOCK, Tom.
SHERLOCK, Got a theory?
SHERLOCK, There are mysteries worth solving and stories worth telling.
SHERLOCK, The best and bravest man I know – and on top of that he actually knows how to do stuff.
SHERLOCK, ... except wedding planning and serviettes – he’s rubbish at those.
JOHN, True!
SHERLOCK," The case itself remains the most ingenious and brilliantly-planned murder – or attempted murder – I’ve ever had the pleasure to encounter; the most perfect locked-room mystery of which I am aware. However, I’m not just here to praise John – I’m also here to embarrass him, so let’s move on to some ..."
SHERLOCK, How was what done?
LESTRADE, The stabbing.
SHERLOCK, I’m afraid I don’t know. I didn’t solve that one. That’s ... (he pauses) ... It can happen sometimes. It’s very ... very disappointing.
SHERLOCK," Embarrassment leads me on to the stag night. Of course there’s hours of material here, but I’ve cut it down to the really good bits."
MOLLY, Murder scenes?
MOLLY, Locations of ... murders?
SHERLOCK," Mmmm, pub crawl – themed."
MOLLY," Yeah, but why-why can’t you just do Underground stations?"
SHERLOCK, Don’t want to get ill. That would ruin it – spoil the mood.
MOLLY, You’re a graduate chemist. Can’t you just work it out?
SHERLOCK, I lack the practical experience. 
MOLLY, Meaning you think I like a drink.
SHERLOCK, Occasionally.
MOLLY, That I’m a drunk.
SHERLOCK, You look ... well.
SHERLOCK, How’s ... 
SHERLOCK, ... Tom?
MOLLY, Not a sociopath.
SHERLOCK, Still? Good.
SHERLOCK, Okay.
SHERLOCK," I want you to calculate John’s ideal intake, and mine, to remain in the sweet spot the whole evening."
SHERLOCK," Light-headed, good ..."
MOLLY," Urinating in wardrobes, bad."
SHERLOCK, Hmm.
SHERLOCK," Two, er ... beers, please."
BARMAN, Pints?
SHERLOCK, Four hundred and forty-three point seven millilitres.
JOHN, Ah...
SHERLOCK, You’ll thank me.
JOHN, Cheers.
SHERLOCK, Cheers.
SHERLOCK, Over there.
SHERLOCK," Toilets. Any second now, you’re going to ..."
SHERLOCK," Mmm, on schedule."
SHERLOCK, Nothing – go!
SHERLOCK, How long?
JOHN, Sorry?
SHERLOCK, Your visit.
SHERLOCK, If you could estimate approximate volume discharged ...
JOHN, Stop talking now.
JOHN," Ooh, er ..."
JOHN," Quick, one more. He mustn’t see."
JOHN, Ta.
JOHN, There you go.
JOHN, Cheers.
SHERLOCK, Thank you.
SHERLOCK, I know ash!
SHERLOCK, Don’t – Tell – Me – I – Don’t!
JOHN," All right, enough! That’s ... "
JOHN, Stand up straight.
JOHN, Yeah.
SHERLOCK, Do you have an international reputation?
JOHN," No, I don’t have an international reputation."
SHERLOCK, No.
SHERLOCK, And I can’t even remember what for.
SHERLOCK, Sss... Crime ... something or other.
MRS HUDSON, Ooh! What are you doing back? I thought you were going to be out late.
MRS HUDSON, You’ve only been out two hours.
JOHN, Am I a vegetable?
SHERLOCK," You, or the thing?"
JOHN, Funny!
JOHN, Come on.
JOHN, It’s your go.
SHERLOCK, Errr ... am I human?
JOHN, Sometimes.
SHERLOCK," Can’t have ‘sometimes.’ Has to be, um ..."
JOHN," Yes, you’re human. (He puts down his glass and slumps back in his seat.)"
SHERLOCK, And am I a man?
JOHN, Yep.
SHERLOCK, Tall?
JOHN, Not as tall as people think.
SHERLOCK, Hmm. Nice?
JOHN, Ish.
SHERLOCK, Clever?
JOHN, I’d say so.
SHERLOCK, You would?
SHERLOCK," Mmm, am I important?"
JOHN, To s-some people.
SHERLOCK, Do “people” ... (he makes vague air-quotes around the word) ... like me?
SHERLOCK, Okay.
SHERLOCK, Am I the current King of England?
JOHN, Are you ...? (He cackles with laughter.) You know we don’t have a king?
SHERLOCK, Don’t we?
JOHN, No. (He chuckles again briefly.)
JOHN, I don’t mind.
JOHN, Am I a woman?
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK, Yes.
JOHN, Am I ... pretty? (He points up to his Rizla.) This.
SHERLOCK," Err ... Er, beauty is a construct based entirely on childhood impressions, influences and role models."
JOHN," Yeah, but am I a pretty lady?"
SHERLOCK, I don’t know who you are. I don’t know who you’re supposed to be.
JOHN, You picked the name!
SHERLOCK, I’m-I’m nice-ish ...
SHERLOCK," ... clever, important to some people, but I tend to rub them up the wrong way."
SHERLOCK, Got it.
JOHN," Go on, then."
SHERLOCK," I’m you, aren’t I?"
MRS HUDSON, Ooh-ooh!
MRS HUDSON, Client!
JOHN, Hallo.
TESSA, Which one of you is Sherlock Holmes?
TESSA," ... and ... he seemed ... nice, you know?"
TESSA," We seemed to automatically connect. We had one night – dinner, such interesting conversation. It was ... lovely."
TESSA," To be honest, I’d love to have gone further ..."
TESSA," ... but I thought, ‘No, this is special. Let’s take it slowly ..."
TESSA, ... exchange numbers.’
TESSA, He said he’d get in touch and then ...
TESSA, Maybe he wasn’t quite as keen as I was ...
TESSA, ... but I – I just thought ... (she becomes tearful) ... at least he’d call to say that we were finished.
TESSA, No trace of him. Mr Holmes ...
TESSA, Mr Holmes?
SHERLOCK, Fascinating!
SHERLOCK, John – John! Wake up!
TESSA," I checked with the landlord, and the man who lived there died. Heart attack. And there we are, having dinner one week on."
TESSA," And I found this thing online, sort of chatroom thing ..."
TESSA, ... for girls who think they’re dating men from the spirit world.
SHERLOCK, Don’t worry. I’ll find him in ten minutes.
SHERLOCK, What’s your dog’s name?
SHERLOCK, John! Wake up!
SHERLOCK, We’re meant to ... (he clicks his fingers) ... The game’s ... (he waves a hand vaguely) ... something.
JOHN, ... on.
SHERLOCK," Yeah, that, that!"
JOHN," Ohhh, it’s nice!"
JOHN, Nice place.
TESSA, See anything?
SHERLOCK, Hmm?
TESSA," Any clues, Mr Holmes?"
SHERLOCK," Oh, errrrrr ..."
SHERLOCK, Mm-hmm?
TESSA, What?
JOHN, He’s ... hmm? He’s clueing for looks.
TESSA, Mr Holmes?
LANDLORD, I’m calling the police.
TESSA," Oh, no ..."
TESSA," This is a famous detective. It’s Sherlock Holmes and his partner, John Hamish Watson."
SHERLOCK," Yeah, that."
JOHN, Greg. Is that Greg?
LESTRADE, Get up. I’m gonna put you two in a taxi. Managed to square things with the desk sergeant.
LESTRADE, What a couple of lightweights! You couldn’t even make it to closing time!
LESTRADE, Come on.
JOHN," Well, thanks for a ... you know ..."
JOHN, ... an evening.
SHERLOCK, It was awful.
JOHN, Yeah.
JOHN," I was gonna pretend, but it was, truly."
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK, Dated a ghost. The most interesting case for months. What a wasted opportunity.
JOHN, ... Okay.
MRS HUDSON, How are you feeling?
JOHN, Mmm. (He drinks again.)
MRS HUDSON," It’s just like old times, having you back here."
MRS HUDSON," Thought I’d make your favourite, one last time."
JOHN," Mm. Don’t sound so ... final about it. I will be visiting, you know."
MRS HUDSON," Ooh, I’ve heard that one before!"
MRS HUDSON," Well, marriage changes everything, John."
JOHN, Does it?
MRS HUDSON, Yeah.
MRS HUDSON," You might not think it, but it does."
MRS HUDSON, It’s a different phase in your life.
MRS HUDSON, You meet new people ’cause you’re a couple ...
JOHN, Mmm.
MRS HUDSON, ... and then you just ... let your old friends slip away.
JOHN, It won’t be like that.
MRS HUDSON," Well, if you’ve found the right one – the person that you click with – it’s the best thing in the world."
JOHN," Well, I have. I know I have."
MRS HUDSON," Oh, I’m sure. She’s lovely!"
JOHN, Yeah. I think so. What about you?
MRS HUDSON, Me?
JOHN, Did you think you’d found the right one when you married Mr Hudson?
JOHN, Right.
MRS HUDSON," And then we moved to Florida. We had a fantastic time, but of course I didn’t know what he was up to. (Whispering) The drugs."
MRS HUDSON," He was running ... um, oh God, what d’you call it? Um, a ... cartel."
MRS HUDSON, Got in with a really bad crowd.
JOHN, Right.
MRS HUDSON," And then I found out about all the other women. I didn’t have a clue! So, when he was actually arrested for blowing someone’s head off ..."
MRS HUDSON," ... it was quite a relief, to be honest."
JOHN, ... Right.
MRS HUDSON, It was purely physical between me and Frank. We couldn’t keep our hands off each other.
MRS HUDSON, I know: there was one night ...
JOHN, Hang on – was that ... Sherlock?
MRS HUDSON, Is it?
JOHN, That’s Sherlock.
s note," to see the full text of the online article about Sholto, together with the newspaper articles which Sherlock looks at later, and the newspaper articles at the beginning of the episode, click here.]"
SHERLOCK, There are going to be others.
JOHN, Others?
SHERLOCK," Victims, women. Most ghosts tend to haunt a single house – this ghost, however, is willing to commute, look."
SHERLOCK," Mmmmmm, not you."
SHERLOCK, Not you.
SHERLOCK, Not you.
SHERLOCK, Not you. Not you.
s note," Your humble transcriber is so anally obsessed with the accuracy of her transcripts that normally she would type every single instance of what follows, carefully counting every “Not you” and the location of the woman to whom Sherlock says it. However, it would probably make for very boring reading and so for speed, convenience and the nurturing of very sore typing fingers, suffice it to say that this scene continues for a long time, with Sherlock dismissing woman after woman, each of whom sits down.]"
SHERLOCK, Hi.
WOMAN, Gail.
SECOND WOMAN, Charlotte.
THIRD WOMAN, Robyn.
FOURTH WOMAN, Vicky.
SHERLOCK, How did you meet?
GAIL, Came up to me in a pub.
CHARLOTTE, Same gym as me.
ROBYN, We just got chatting on the bus.
VICKY, Online.
SHERLOCK, Name?
GAIL, Told you.
SHERLOCK, His name.
GAIL, Oscar.
CHARLOTTE, Mike.
ROBYN, Terry.
VICKY," Um, “love_monkey.”"
SHERLOCK, Your place?
GAIL, Nothing happened. It was just ... very romantic.
GAIL, He was very charming.
CHARLOTTE, He listened.
ROBYN, He was sweet.
VICKY, He had a lovely ...
JOHN, You okay?
VICKY," He had a lovely ...” Also on the table is a plate containing a slice of gammon steak with a pineapple slice on top of it, a fried egg and some chips.)"
JOHN, Let your food go cold. Mrs Hudson’ll play hell.
SHERLOCK," Not now, John."
SHERLOCK, Sorry about that.”
SHERLOCK, Sorry about that.
VICKY, He had a lovely manner.
SHERLOCK," Different names, different addresses."
SHERLOCK, Describe him.
GAIL, Short blond hair.
CHARLOTTE, Dark hair – long.
ROBYN, Ginger. (She shrugs.) I like gingers.
VICKY, Couldn’t tell.
SHERLOCK, He’s stealing the identity of corpses ...
SHERLOCK, ... getting the names from the Obituary columns.
SHERLOCK, All single men. He’s using the dead man’s flat under the assumption it’ll be empty for a while.
SHERLOCK, Free love nest.
ROBYN, It’s gruesome.
CHARLOTTE, That’s awful.
TESSA, Bastard!
TESSA," BASTARD!” He types onto that computer and his message appears reading, “SHERLOCK: Hello Tessa”."
SHERLOCK," Hello, Tessa."
SHERLOCK," Meanwhile, back to business. No-one wants to use a dead man’s home."
SHERLOCK," ... Least not until it’s been cleared. So, he disguises himself, steals the man’s home, steals his identity."
JOHN, Then he’s gone.
SHERLOCK," He’s not a ghost, John. He’s a mayfly. He lives for a day."
SHERLOCK, So – what was it he was looking for?
SHERLOCK, Job.
GAIL, Gardener. (She is now wearing a pale jumper and overalls.)
CHARLOTTE, Cook. (She’s wearing a cook’s jacket and hat.)
ROBYN, I do security work. (She’s wearing a security officer’s uniform.)
SHERLOCK, Obvious. You all work for the same person!
SHERLOCK," No, not the same employer. Damn."
SHERLOCK, Come on. We can do this.
SHERLOCK, Ideal night out.
GAIL, Clay pigeon shooting.
CHARLOTTE, Line dancing.
ROBYN, Wine in front of the telly.
SHERLOCK, Make-up.
GAIL, Clarins.
CHARLOTTE, No. 7.
TESSA, Maybelline.
ROBYN, Nothing special.
VICKY, Whatever’s cheap.
SHERLOCK, Perfume.
GAIL, Chanel.
CHARLOTTE, Chanel.
TESSA, Chanel.
ROBYN, Chanel.
VICKY, Estée Lauder.
SHERLOCK, Ideal man?
SHERLOCK," Oh, no."
GAIL, Home-loving.
CHARLOTTE, He’d have to like cuddling.
ROBYN, Caring.
VICKY, Ten things. (She holds up her thumb.) One: someone who isn’t competitive with other men.
 Two, someone who isn’t constantly trying to define himself by his masculinity ...
SHERLOCK, There’s a unifying factor. There has to be.
SHERLOCK, None of you reported anything stolen.
SHERLOCK," Security guard, gardener, cook, maid, private nurse. He’s romancing his way up a pecking order, somebody’s pecking order."
SHERLOCK, Unless ...
SHERLOCK, Do you have a secret you’ve never told anyone?
SHERLOCK, Gotcha.
SHERLOCK," Everyone has secrets, and they all replied too quickly."
CHARLOTTE, See ya.
SHERLOCK, No!
ROBYN, Bye-bye. (She leaves/logs off.)
SHERLOCK, Wait!
VICKY," Sorry, sexy. (She winks at him.) Some secrets have to stay secret."
SHERLOCK, Why? Why would he date all of those women and not return their calls?
JOHN," You’re missing the obvious, mate."
JOHN, He’s a man.
JOHN, Maybe he’s married.
SHERLOCK, Ohh.
SHERLOCK," Married. Obvious, really. Our Mayfly Man was trying to escape the suffocating chains of domesticity ..."
SHERLOCK," ... and instead of endless nights in watching the telly or going to barbecues with awful dreadful boring people he couldn’t stand, he used his wits, cleverness and powers of disguise ... (he finally takes a breath, and smiles slightly) ... to play the field. He was ..."
SHERLOCK," On second thoughts I probably should have told you about the Elephant in the Room. However, it does help to further illustrate how invaluable John is to me. I can read a crime scene the way he can understand a human being. I used to think that’s what made me special – quite frankly, I still do. But a word to the wise: should any of you require the services of either of us, I will solve your murder, but it takes John Watson to save your life. Trust me on that – I should know. He’s saved mine so many times, and in so many ways."
SHERLOCK, This blog is the story of two men and their frankly ridiculous adventures ...
SHERLOCK," ... of murder, mystery and mayhem. But from now on, there’s a new story – a bigger adventure."
SHERLOCK," Ladies and gentlemen, pray charge your glasses and be upstanding."
SHERLOCK, The two reasons why every single one of us is ...
SHERLOCK, What did you say?
SHERLOCK, Henry?
SHERLOCK, Humphrey?
SHERLOCK, Took him years to confide in me. 
JOHN, That’s my birth certificate.
SHERLOCK, Yep.
SHERLOCK, And The Woman – she knew.
JOHN, John Hamish Watson – just if you were looking for baby names.
JOHN, Does it have to be on the invitation?
MARY, It’s your name. 
MARY, It’s traditional.
TESSA, Enjoy the wedding.
MYCROFT, What do we say about coincidence?
MYCROFT," So, the balance of probability is ...?"
SHERLOCK, Someone went to great lengths to find out something about this wedding.
MYCROFT, What great lengths?
MYCROFT, Which suggests ...?
SHERLOCK, Criminal intent.
MYCROFT, Also suggests ...?
SHERLOCK," Intelligence, planning."
MYCROFT, Clearly. But more importantly ...?
MASTER OF CEREMONIES," Another glass, sir?"
SHERLOCK," Now, where were we?"
SHERLOCK, And down again.
SHERLOCK," Ladies and gentlemen, people tell you not to milk a good speech – get off early, leave ’em laughing. Wise advice I’ll certainly try to bear in mind. But for now ..."
SHERLOCK, ... part two.
SHERLOCK," Part two is more action-based. I’m gonna ... walk around, shake things up a bit."
SHERLOCK, Who’d go to a wedding? That’s the question. Who would bother to go to any lengths to get themselves to a wedding?
SHERLOCK," Well, everyone."
SHERLOCK, Weddings are great! Love a wedding.
SHERLOCK, ... and he can cook. Does ... a ... thing ... thing with peas ...
SHERLOCK, ... once. Might not be peas. Might not be him. But he’s got a great singing voice ... or somebody does.
SHERLOCK," Ahh, too many, too many, too many, too many!"
SHERLOCK," Sorry. Too many jokes about John! Now, er ..."
MYCROFT, Criminal intent.
SHERLOCK," Sorry, did I say ‘murder’? I meant to say ‘marriage’ – but, you know, they’re quite similar procedures when you think about it. The participants tend to know each other, and it’s over when one of them’s dead."
SHERLOCK," In fairness, murder is a lot quicker, though. Janine!"
SHERLOCK," Also, he’s a comics and sci-fi geek. They’re always tremendously grateful – really put the hours in."
SHERLOCK," Geoff, the gents."
SHERLOCK," The loos, now, please."
LESTRADE, It’s Greg.
SHERLOCK," The loos, please."
SHERLOCK," Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s your turn."
LESTRADE," Yeah, actually, now you mention it ..."
JOHN," Sherlock, any chance of a – an end date for this speech? Gotta cut the cake."
SHERLOCK," Oh! Ladies and gentlemen, can’t stand it when I finally get the chance to speak for once, Vatican Cameos."
MARY, What did he say? What’s that mean?
MARY, What?!
SHERLOCK," (loudly, angrily, in the reception room): No!"
SHERLOCK, Not you! Not you!
JOHN, What do I do?
SHERLOCK," Well, you’ve already done it. Don’t solve the murder. (Intensely) Save the life."
SHERLOCK, Sorry. Off-piste a bit. Back now. (High-pitched) Phew!
SHERLOCK, Let’s play a game.
SHERLOCK, Let’s play Murder.
MRS HUDSON," I think you’re a popular choice at the moment, dear."
SHERLOCK," Most people you can kill any old place. As a mental exercise, I’ve often planned the murder of friends and colleagues."
SHERLOCK, Now John I’d poison.
SHERLOCK," Sloppy eater – dead easy. I’ve given him chemicals and compounds – that way, he’s never even noticed. He missed a whole Wednesday once, didn’t have a clue. Lestrade’s so easy to kill, it’s a miracle no-one’s succumbed to the temptation. (He turns and heads towards the back of the room again.) I’ve got a pair of keys to my brother’s house – I could easily break in there and asphyxiate him."
SHERLOCK," ... if, if the whim arose."
SHERLOCK," So, once again, who could you only kill here?"
SHERLOCK," Clearly it’s a rare opportunity, so it’s someone who doesn’t get out much."
SHERLOCK, Someone for whom a planned social encounter known about months in advance is an exception. Has to be a unique opportunity.
SHERLOCK, And since killing someone in public is difficult ... 
SHERLOCK," ... killing them in private isn’t an option. Someone who lives in an inaccessible or unknown location, then."
SHERLOCK," Someone private, perhaps, obsessed with personal security."
SHERLOCK, Possibly someone under threat.
SHERLOCK, Major James Sholto. Who he?
MARY, I don’t think he’s coming.
JOHN, He’ll be there.
JOHN, Where are you living these days?
SHOLTO," Oh, way out in the middle of nowhere."
SHERLOCK," Ooh! A recluse, small household staff."
SHERLOCK, Job. 
GAIL, Gardener.
CHARLOTTE, Cook.
TESSA, Private nurse.
VICKY, Maid.
ROBYN, I do security work.
SHERLOCK, Do you have a secret you’ve never told anyone?
 a huge one, how would you do it? How would you kill someone in public?
SHERLOCK, There has to be a way. This has been planned.
ARCHIE, The invisible man could do it.
ARCHIE, The invisible man with the invisible knife. The one who tried to kill the Guardsman.
SHERLOCK," Ladies and gentlemen, there will now be a short interlude."
SHERLOCK, The bride and groom!
GUESTS, The bride and groom.
SHERLOCK," Major Sholto’s going to be murdered. I don’t know how or by whom, but it’s going to happen."
SHERLOCK," ’Scuse me, coming through!"
MARY, Please be careful.
JOHN, ’Scuse me. Coming through! ’Scuse me.
JOHN, How can you not remember which room? You remember everything.
MARY, Two oh seven.
SHERLOCK, Major Sholto!
JOHN," Major, let us in."
MARY, Kick the door down.
SHOLTO, I really wouldn’t. I have a gun in my hand and a lifetime of unfortunate reflexes.
SHOLTO, “The invisible man with the invisible knife.” 
SHERLOCK," I don’t know how he does it, so I can’t stop him, and that means he’ll do it again."
SHERLOCK, I – I’m sorry?
SHOLTO, You’re the famous Mr Holmes. Solve the case. On you go.
SHOLTO, Tell me how he did it and I’ll open the door.
JOHN," Please, this is no time for games. Just let us in! You’re in danger!"
SHOLTO," So are you, so long as you’re here."
SHOLTO," Please, leave me. Despite my reputation, I really don’t approve of collateral damage."
SHERLOCK, Sorry?
MARY," Solve it, and he’ll open the door, like he said."
SHERLOCK," If I couldn’t solve it before, how can I solve it now?"
MARY, Because it matters now.
SHERLOCK, What are you talking about? (He looks at John.) What’s she talking about? Get your wife under control.
JOHN, She’s right.
SHERLOCK," Oh, you’ve changed!"
JOHN," No, she is. (He turns and points at him.) Shut up. You are not a puzzle-solver – you never have been. You’re a drama queen."
MARY," Yeah, I know."
SHERLOCK," Major Sholto, no-one’s coming to kill you. I’m afraid you’ve already been killed several hours ago."
SHOLTO, What did you say?
SHERLOCK, Don’t take off your belt.
SHOLTO, My belt?
SHERLOCK," Tight belt, worn high on the waist. Very easy to push a small blade through the fabric and you wouldn’t even feel it."
JOHN, The-the belt would bind the flesh together when it was tied tight ...
SHERLOCK, Exactly.
JOHN, ... and when you took it off ...
SHERLOCK, Delayed action stabbing. All the time in the world to create an alibi.
SHERLOCK, Major Sholto?
SHOLTO, So – I was to be killed by my uniform. How appropriate.
MARY," He solved the case, Major. You’re supposed to open the door now. A deal is a deal."
SHOLTO, I’m not even supposed to have this any more. They gave me special dispensation to keep it. I couldn’t imagine life out of this uniform. I suppose – given the circumstances – I don’t have to.
SHOLTO," When so many want you dead, it hardly seems good manners to argue."
JOHN," Whatever you’re doing in there, James, stop it, right now. I will kick this door down."
SHOLTO," Mr Holmes, you and I are similar, I think."
SHERLOCK," Yes, I think we are."
SHOLTO," There’s a proper time to die, isn’t there?"
SHERLOCK, Of course there is.
SHOLTO, And one should embrace it when it comes – like a soldier.
JOHN, I’m gonna break it down.
MARY," No, wait, wait, you won’t have to."
JOHN, Hmm?
SHOLTO, I believe I am in need of medical attention.
JOHN, I believe I am your doctor.
SHERLOCK," One, two, three; der, der, der ... Ahh, pretty good."
JANINE, Ooh!
JANINE," Well, you’re a good teacher."
SHERLOCK, Mmm.
JANINE, And you’re a brilliant dancer.
SHERLOCK, I love dancing. I’ve always loved it.
JANINE, Seriously?
JANINE, Ooh! Woah!
JANINE, ... whatever it is you are.
SHERLOCK, I know.
JOHN," Well, glad to see you’ve pulled, Sherlock, what with murderers running riot at my wedding."
SHERLOCK, One murder... – one nearly murderer. (To Janine) Loves to exaggerate. You should try living with him.
LESTRADE, Sherlock? (He points back out the door.) Got him for you.
SHERLOCK," Er, may I have a look at your camera?"
PHOTOGRAPHER, Er ... (he pulls his camera back nervously but then holds it out to him) ... what’s this about? I was halfway home!
SHERLOCK," Ah, yes. Yes, very good. There, you see? (He smiles.) Perfect. "
LESTRADE, What is? You gonna tell us?
SHERLOCK, It’s not what’s in the photographs; it’s what’s not in them – not in any of them.
JOHN, Sherlock? The showing-off thing: we’ve discussed it before.
SHERLOCK," There is always a man at a wedding who is not in any photograph but can go anywhere, and even carry an equipment bag around with him if he likes, and you never even see his face. (He walks closer to the photographer and looks down towards his hand.) You only ever see ..."
SHERLOCK, ... the camera.
PHOTOGRAPHER, What are you doing? What is this?
SHERLOCK," ... an invitation to a wedding – the one time Sholto would have to be out in public. So, he made his plan ..."
SHERLOCK, ... and rehearsed the murder ...
SHERLOCK, ... making sure of every last detail.
SHERLOCK," Brilliant, ruthless, almost certainly a monomaniac – though, in fairness, his photographs are actually quite good."
SHERLOCK, Everything you need’s on that. You probably ought to ... arrest him or something.
JANINE, Do you always carry handcuffs?
SHERLOCK," Down, girl."
SMALL," It’s not me you should be arresting, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK," Oh, I don’t do the arresting. (He nods towards Greg.) I just farm that out."
SMALL," Sholto – he’s the killer, not me. I should have killed him quicker."
SMALL, I shouldn’t have tried to be clever.
LESTRADE, Right ...
MARY, Really?!
JANINE, Yeah!
SHERLOCK," Ladies and gentlemen, just, er, one last thing before the evening begins properly. Apologies for earlier. A crisis arose and was dealt with."
SHERLOCK," More importantly, however, today we saw two people make vows. I’ve never made a vow in my life, and after tonight I never will again. So, here in front of you all, my first and last vow. Mary and John: whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on I swear I will always be there, always, for all three of you."
SHERLOCK," Er, I’m sorry, I mean, I mean two of you. All two of you. Both of you, in fact. I’ve just miscounted."
SHERLOCK," Anyway, it’s time for dancing. (Over his shoulder to the DJ on the stage) Play the music again, please, thank you."
SHERLOCK," Okay, everybody, just dance. Don’t be shy!"
SHERLOCK," Dancing, please!"
SHERLOCK, Very good!
SHERLOCK," Sorry, that was one more deduction than I was really expecting."
MARY, “Deduction”?
SHERLOCK, ... change of taste perception ...
SHERLOCK, ... and you were sick this morning. You assumed it was just wedding nerves. You got angry with me when I mentioned it to you. All the signs are there.
MARY, “The signs”?
SHERLOCK, The signs of three.
MARY, What?!
SHERLOCK," Mary, I think you should do a pregnancy test."
SHERLOCK, W... th... the statistics for the first trimester are ...
JOHN, Just ... shut up.
SHERLOCK, Sorry.
SHERLOCK, It’s your day off.
JOHN, It’s your day off!
SHERLOCK, Stop-stop panicking.
JOHN, I’m not panicking.
MARY, I’m pregnant – I’m panicking.
SHERLOCK, Don’t panic. None of you panic.
SHERLOCK, Absolutely no reason to panic.
JOHN," Oh, and you’d know, of course?"
SHERLOCK," Yes, I would. You’re already the best parents in the world. Look at all the practice you’ve had!"
JOHN, What practice?
SHERLOCK," Well, you’re hardly gonna need me around now that you’ve got a real baby on the way."
JOHN, Mm?
SHERLOCK," Both of you, now, go dance. We can’t just stand here. People will wonder what we’re talking about."
JOHN, Right.
MARY, And what about you?
JOHN," Well, we can’t all three dance. There are limits!"
SHERLOCK," Yes, there are."
MARY," Come on, husband. Let’s go."
SHERLOCK," Don’t worry, Mary, I have been tutoring him."
JOHN," He did, you know. Baker Street, behind closed curtains."
JOHN, Mrs Hudson came in one time. Don’t know how those rumours started!
LADY SMALLWOOD," Mr Magnussen, how would you describe your influence over the Prime Minister?"
MAGNUSSEN, The British Prime Minister?
LADY SMALLWOOD, Any of the British Prime Ministers you have known.
MAGNUSSEN, I never had the slightest influence over any of them. Why would I?
MAGNUSSEN, Because I was invited.
LADY SMALLWOOD, Can you recall the subjects under discussion? 
MAGNUSSEN, Not without being more indiscreet than I believe is appropriate.
GARVIE," Do you think it right that a newspaper proprietor, a private individual and, in fact, a foreign national should have such regular access to our Prime Minister?"

ATTENDANT," Your car’s waiting outside, sir. See you tomorrow."
MAGNUSSEN, May I join you?
LADY SMALLWOOD, I don’t think it’s appropriate.
MAGNUSSEN, It isn’t.
LADY SMALLWOOD," Mr Magnussen, outside the enquiry we can have no contact, no communication at all."
LADY SMALLWOOD, Please don’t do that.
MAGNUSSEN, In 1982 your husband corresponded with Helen Catherine Driscoll.
LADY SMALLWOOD, That was before I knew him.
MAGNUSSEN," The letters were lively, loving – some would say explicit – and currently in my possession."
LADY SMALLWOOD, Will you please move your hand?
LADY SMALLWOOD, I know what was in the letters.
MAGNUSSEN, She was fifteen.
LADY SMALLWOOD, She looked older.
MAGNUSSEN," Oh, she looked delicious. We have photographs, too – the ones she sent him. (He smacks his lips.) Yum yum."
LADY SMALLWOOD," He was unaware of her age. He met her only once before the letters began. When he discovered the truth, he stopped immediately. Those are the facts."
MAGNUSSEN, Facts are for history books. I work in news.
LADY SMALLWOOD, Your hand is sweating.
MAGNUSSEN," Always, I’m afraid. I have a condition."
LADY SMALLWOOD, It’s disgusting.
MAGNUSSEN," Ah, I’m used to it. (He strokes his finger across the top of her hand.) The whole world is wet to my touch."
LADY SMALLWOOD, I will call someone. I will have you removed.
MAGNUSSEN, What is that?
MAGNUSSEN," Claire de la Lune? (He looks up at her.) A bit young for you, isn’t it?"
MAGNUSSEN," You want to hit me now? Could you, still? You’re an old lady now. Perhaps you should settle for calling someone."
MAGNUSSEN, Well? Go on.
MAGNUSSEN, No? Because now there are consequences. I have the letters and therefore I have you.
LADY SMALLWOOD, This is blackmail.
MAGNUSSEN, Of course it isn’t blackmail. This is ... ownership.
LADY SMALLWOOD, You do not own me.
MAGNUSSEN, Claire de la Lune.
MAGNUSSEN," It never tastes like it smells, does it?"
ATTENDANT," Yes, Mr Magnussen."
CHAUFFEUR," You all right, ma’am?"
LADY SMALLWOOD," Fine, yes."
LADY SMALLWOOD, There isn’t a man or woman in England capable of stopping that disgusting creature ...
CHAUFFEUR, Ma’am?
LADY SMALLWOOD, Turn the car around. We’re going back into town. Turn around.
CHAUFFEUR," Where are we going, ma’am?"
LADY SMALLWOOD, Baker Street.
SHERLOCK, The game is on. (He smiles.)
MARY, Is that Kate?
JOHN," Y-yeah, it’s Kate."
MARY, Invite her in?
JOHN," Er, sorry, yes. D-d’you wanna come in, Kate?"
MARY, It’s all right.
JOHN, There you go.
MARY, Son.
JOHN," Son, yeah."
KATE, He’s gone missing again. Didn’t come home last night.
MARY, The usual.
JOHN," He’s the drugs one, yeah?"
MARY," Er, yeah, nicely put, John."
JOHN," Look, is it Sherlock Holmes you want? Because I’ve not seen him in ages."
MARY, About a month.
KATE, Who’s Sherlock Holmes?
KATE," There’s a – a place they all go to, him and his ... friends."
KATE," ... shoot up, whatever you call it."
JOHN, Where is he?
KATE," It’s a house. It’s a dump. I mean, it’s practically falling down."
JOHN," No, the address."
JOHN," Where, exactly?"
MARY, Seriously?
JOHN, I’m being neighbourly. 
MARY, Since when?
MARY, Why are you being so ...? 
MARY, I dunno. What’s the matter with you?
MARY, I’m trying.
JOHN," No, you can’t come. You’re pregnant."
MARY, You can’t go. I’m pregnant.
MARY, What is that?!
JOHN, It’s a tyre lever.
MARY, Why?
MARY," Er, John, John, John, John."
MARY, It is a tiny bit sexy.
JOHN, Hello?
BILL, What d’you want?
JOHN, ’Scuse me.
BILL," Naah, naah, you can’t come in ’ere!"
JOHN, A very specific friend – I’m not just browsing.
BILL, You’ve gotta go. No-one’s allowed ’ere.
JOHN," I’m asking you if you’ve seen Isaac Whitney, and now you’re showing me a knife. Is it a clue?"
JOHN, Are you doing a mime?
BILL, Go. Or I’ll cut you.
JOHN," Ooh, not from there. Let me help."
BILL," Okay, you asked for it."
JOHN, Right.
JOHN, Are you concentrating yet?
BILL, You broke my arm!
JOHN," No, I sprained it."
BILL, It feels squishy! Is it supposed to feel squishy?
BILL, Feel that!
JOHN," Yeah, it’s a sprain. I’m a doctor – I know how to sprain people."
JOHN, Now where is Isaac Whitney?
BILL, I don’t know!
BILL, Maybe upstairs.
JOHN, There you go. (He pats Bill’s leg.) Wasn’t that easy?
JOHN, Isaac? Isaac Whitney?
JOHN," Hello, mate."
JOHN, Sit up for me? Sit up.
ISAAC, Doctor Watson?
ISAAC, Where am I?
JOHN, The arse-end of the universe with the scum of the Earth. Look at me.
JOHN, D’you think I know a lot of people here?!
JOHN," Hey, all right?"
SHERLOCK, Didn’t expect to see you here.
SHERLOCK," Did you come for me, too?"
MARY," Hallo, Isaac."
SHERLOCK, I’m working.
JOHN, Sherlock Holmes in a drug den! How’s that gonna look?
SHERLOCK, I’m undercover.
JOHN, No you’re not!
BILL, Please. Can I come? I think I’ve got a broken arm.
MARY, No. Go away.
JOHN," No, let him."
MARY, Why?
MARY," Anyone else? I mean, we’re taking everybody home, are we?"
BILL," All right, Shezza?"
MARY," Seriously – “Shezza,” though?! "
JOHN, We’re not going home. We’re going to Bart’s. I’m calling Molly.
MARY, Why?
JOHN, Well? Is he clean?
MOLLY, Clean?
MOLLY, How dare you throw away the beautiful gifts you were born with?
MOLLY, And how dare you betray the love of your friends? Say you’re sorry.
MOLLY, Stop it. (Angrily) Just stop it.
JOHN," If you were anywhere near this kind of thing again, you could have called, you could have talked to me."
SHERLOCK, Please do relax. This is all for a case.
JOHN, A ca... What kind of case would need you doing this?
SHERLOCK, I might as well ask you why you’ve started cycling to work.
SHERLOCK," Quite recently, I’d say. You’re very determined about it."
JOHN, Not interested.
BILL, I am.
BILL, Ow.
MARY," Oh, sorry. You moved. But it is just a sprain."
BILL, Yeah. Somebody ’it me.
MARY, Huh?
BILL," Eh, just some guy."
JOHN," Yeah, probably just an addict in need of a fix."
BILL, Is it his shirt?
BILL," Well, it’s the creases, innit?"
BILL, The two creases down the front. It’s been recently folded but it’s not new.
BILL, Must have dressed in a hurry this morning ...
BILL, ... so all your shirts must be kept like that.
BILL," But why? Maybe ’cause you cycle to work every morning, shower when you get there an’ then dress in the clothes you brought with you."
BILL, ... ready to pack.
SHERLOCK, Not bad.
BILL," ... you’ve only started recently, because you’ve got a bit of chafing."
SHERLOCK, No – he’s always walked like that. Remind me – what’s your name again?
BILL, They call me The Wig.
SHERLOCK, No they don’t.
SHERLOCK, Nope.
SHERLOCK," Nice observational skills, Billy."
SHERLOCK, Ah! Finally.
MOLLY, “Finally” what?
BILL, Good news?
SHERLOCK," Oh, excellent news – the best."
SHERLOCK, There’s every chance that my drug habit might hit the newspapers. The game is on.
SHERLOCK, Excuse me for a second.
SHERLOCK," You’ve heard of Charles Augustus Magnussen, of course."
JOHN, Yeah. Owns some newspapers – ones I don’t read.
SHERLOCK, Hang on – weren’t there other people?
JOHN, Mary’s taking the boys home; I’m taking you. We did discuss it.
SHERLOCK," People were talking, none of them me. I must have filtered."
JOHN, I noticed.
SHERLOCK, I have to filter out a lot of witless babble. I’ve got Mrs Hudson on semi-permanent mute.
SHERLOCK, What is my brother doing here? 
SHERLOCK, He’s straightened the knocker.
SHERLOCK, He always corrects it. He’s OCD. Doesn’t even know he’s doing it.
JOHN, Why’d you do that?
SHERLOCK, Do what?
JOHN, Nothing.
MYCROFT," Well, then, Sherlock. Back on the sauce?"
SHERLOCK, What are you doing here?
JOHN, I phoned him.
MYCROFT," The siren call of old habits. How very like Uncle Rudy – though, in many ways, cross-dressing would have been a wiser path for you."
JOHN, ’Course I bloody phoned him. 
MYCROFT," ’Course he bloody did. Now, save me a little time. Where should we be looking?"
SHERLOCK, “We”?
BENJI," Oh, that’s him, isn’t it?"
BENJI, You said he’d be taller.
MYCROFT," You’re a celebrity these days, Sherlock. You can’t afford a drug habit."
JOHN," Hey, what happened to my chair?"
SHERLOCK, It was blocking my view to the kitchen.
SHERLOCK," Well, you were gone. I saw an opportunity."
JOHN," No, you saw the kitchen."
MYCROFT, What have you found so far? Clearly nothing.
SHERLOCK, There’s nothing to find.
SHERLOCK," Okay, stop! Just stop."
SHERLOCK, Point made.
JOHN," Jesus, Sherlock."
MYCROFT," Have to phone our parents, of course, in Oklahoma."
MYCROFT, Won’t be the first time that your substance abuse has wreaked havoc with their line-dancing.
SHERLOCK, This is not what you think. This is for a case.
MYCROFT, What case could possibly justify this?
SHERLOCK, Magnussen.
SHERLOCK, Charles Augustus Magnussen.
MYCROFT," That name you think you may have just heard – you were mistaken. If you ever mention hearing that name in this room, in this context, I guarantee you – on behalf of the British security services – that materials will be found on your computer hard drives resulting in your immediate incarceration. Don’t reply – just look frightened and scuttle."
MYCROFT, I hope I won’t have to threaten you as well.
JOHN," Well, I think we’d both find that embarrassing."
MYCROFT, You may consider him under my protection.
SHERLOCK, I consider you under his thumb.
SHERLOCK," Er, what was I going to say? Oh, yeah."
SHERLOCK, Bye-bye.
MYCROFT," Unwise, brother mine."
SHERLOCK," Brother mine, don’t appal me when I’m high."
JOHN, Oh.
JOHN," Er, Magnussen?"
SHERLOCK, What time is it?
JOHN, About eight.
SHERLOCK, I’m meeting him in three hours. I need a bath.
JOHN," It’s for a case, you said?"
SHERLOCK, Yep.
JOHN, What sort of case?
SHERLOCK, Too big and dangerous for any sane individual to get involved in.
JOHN, You trying to put me off?
SHERLOCK," God, no."
SHERLOCK, Trying to recruit you.
JANINE," Oh, John, hi."
JANINE, How are you?
JANINE, Sorry. Not dressed.
JANINE, Has everybody gone? I heard shouting.
JOHN," Yes, they’re gone."
JANINE, Sounded like an argument. (She turns to John.) Was it Mike?
JOHN, Mike?
JANINE," Mike, yeah. His brother, Mike. They’re always fighting."
JOHN, Mycroft.
JANINE, Do people actually call him that?!
JOHN, Yeah.
JANINE," Huh! Oh, could you be a love and put some coffee on?"
JOHN," ... Sure, right, yeah."
JANINE," Ooh, how’s Mary? How’s married life?"
JOHN," She’s fine. We’re both fine, yeah."
JANINE," Oh, it’s over there now."
JANINE, Where’s Sherl?
JOHN, He’s just having a bath. I’m sure he’ll be out in a minute.
JANINE," Oh, like he ever is!"
JOHN, Yeah(!)
JANINE, Morning! Room for a little one?!
SHERLOCK, So – it’s just a guess but you’ve probably got some questions.
JOHN," Yyyyeah, one or two, pretty much."
SHERLOCK, Naturally.
JOHN, You have a girlfriend?
SHERLOCK," Now, Magnussen. Magnussen is like a shark – it’s the only way I can describe him. Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London Aquarium, John – stood up close to the glass? Those floating flat faces, those dead eyes ... That’s what he is. I’ve dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen."
JOHN," Yes, you have."
SHERLOCK," Sorry, what?"
JOHN, You have a girlfriend.
SHERLOCK," What? Yes! Yes, I’m going out with Janine. I thought that was fairly obvious."
JOHN," Yes. Well ... yes. (He clears his throat loudly.) But I mean you, you, you ... are in a relationship?"
SHERLOCK," Yes, I am."
JOHN, You and Janine?
SHERLOCK," Mmm, yes. Me and Janine."
JOHN, Care to elaborate?
SHERLOCK," Well, we’re in a good place. It’s, um ... (he looks down thoughtfully, then turns to John) ... very affirming."
JOHN, You got that from a book.
SHERLOCK, Everyone got that from a book.
JANINE," Okay, you two bad boys, behave yourselves."
JANINE," And you, Sherl, you’re gonna have to tell me where you were last night."
SHERLOCK, Working.
JANINE," “Working.” Of course. I’m the only one who really knows what you’re like, remember?"
JANINE, I haven’t told Mary about this. I kind of wanted to surprise her.
JOHN," Yeah, you probably will."
JANINE, But we should have you two over for dinner really soon!
SHERLOCK, Yeah!
JANINE," My place, though – not the scuzz-dump!"
JOHN," Great, yeah! Dinner! Yeah."
SHERLOCK, Have a lovely day. Call me later.
JANINE," Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes."
SHERLOCK," You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner, but he’s so much more than that."
SHERLOCK," He uses his power and wealth to gain information. The more he acquires, the greater his wealth and power."
SHERLOCK, I’m not exaggerating when I say that he knows the critical pressure point on every person of note or influence in the whole of the Western world and probably beyond. He is the Napoleon of blackmail ...
SHERLOCK, ... and he has created an unassailable architecture of forbidden knowledge. Its name ...
SHERLOCK, ... is Appledore.
JOHN, Dinner.
SHERLOCK," Sorry, what, dinner?"
JOHN," Me and Mary, coming for dinner ... with ... wine and ... sitting."
SHERLOCK, Seriously? I’ve just told you that the Western world is run from this house ... (he points at the screen) ... and you want to talk about dinner?
JOHN," Fine, talk about the house."
SHERLOCK," It is the greatest repository of sensitive and dangerous information anywhere in the world ... (he looks over his shoulder at John) ... the Alexandrian Library of secrets and scandals – and none of it is on a computer. He’s smart – computers can be hacked. It’s all on hard copy in vaults ... (he points at the rotating blueprint on the screen) ... underneath that house; and as long as it is, the personal freedom of anyone you’ve ever met is a fantasy."
SHERLOCK, It’s in the fridge. It kept ringing.
MRS HUDSON," Oh, that’s not a fault, Sherlock!"
JOHN, Who is it?
MRS HUDSON, Mr Holmes said you can go right up.

MAGNUSSEN, Sorry. (He shakes his head.) S-sorry. You were probably talking?
SHERLOCK, I ...
SHERLOCK, I was trying to explain that I’ve been asked to act on behalf of ...
MAGNUSSEN, Bathroom?
MAGNUSSEN, Okay.
SHERLOCK, I’m aware you do not make copies of sensitive documents ...
SECURITY MAN, Sir?
MAGNUSSEN, The bathroom?
SECURITY MAN," Er, yes, sir."
MAGNUSSEN," Maybe not, then."
SHERLOCK, Am I acceptable to you as an intermediary?
MAGNUSSEN, Lady Elizabeth Smallwood. I like her.
SHERLOCK," Mr Magnussen, am I acceptable to you as an intermediary?"
MAGNUSSEN," She’s English, with a spine."
MAGNUSSEN, Best thing about the English ...
MAGNUSSEN," ... you’re so domesticated. All standing around, apologising ..."
MAGNUSSEN, ... keeping your little heads down.
MAGNUSSEN, You can do what you like here. No-one’s ever going to stop you.
MAGNUSSEN," I’ve interests all over the world but, er, everything starts in England."
MAGNUSSEN, If it works here ...
MAGNUSSEN, ... I’ll try it in a real country.
MAGNUSSEN," The United Kingdom, huh? (He starts to wipe his fingers.) Petri dish to the Western world."
MAGNUSSEN," Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need those letters, so I’m keeping them."
MAGNUSSEN, Goodbye.
MAGNUSSEN, Anyway ...
MAGNUSSEN, ... they’re funny.
SHERLOCK, Did you notice the one extraordinary thing he did?
JOHN," Wh... There was a moment that kind of stuck in the mind, yeah."
SHERLOCK, Exactly – when he showed us the letters.
JOHN, ... Okay.
SHERLOCK," So he’s brought the letters to London – so no matter what he says, he’s ready to make a deal. Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once he’s established a person’s weaknesses – the ‘pressure point,’ he calls it."
SHERLOCK," So, clearly he believes I’m a drug addict and no serious threat."
JOHN, How-how do you know his schedule?
SHERLOCK, Because I do. Right – I’ll see you tonight. I’ve got some shopping to do.
SHERLOCK, You are! I checked!
SHERLOCK, Don’t bring a gun.
JOHN, Why would I bring a gun?
SHERLOCK," Or a knife, or a tyre lever. Probably best not to do any arm-spraining, but we’ll see how the night goes."
JOHN, You’re just assuming I’m coming along?
SHERLOCK," Time you got out of the house, John. (He runs his eyes over him as the taxi pulls up.) You’ve put on seven pounds since you got married, and the cycling isn’t doing it."
JOHN, It’s actually four pounds.
SHERLOCK, Hatton Garden.
SHERLOCK," Magnussen’s office is on the top floor, just below his private flat ... (he looks towards lift doors on the next level up) ... but there are fourteen levels of security between us and him ..."
SHERLOCK, ... two of which aren’t even legal in this country. Want to know how we’re going to break in?
JOHN, Is that what we’re doing?
SHERLOCK, Of course it’s what we’re doing.
SHERLOCK," Magnussen’s private lift. It goes straight to his penthouse and office. Only he uses it ... (they get onto the escalator) ... and only his key card calls the lift. Anyone else even tries, security is automatically informed."
SHERLOCK," Here we go, then."
SHERLOCK," If I was to use this card on that lift now, what happens?"
SHERLOCK, Exactly.
JOHN, Get taken to a small room somewhere and your head kicked in.
SHERLOCK, Do we really need so much colour?
JOHN, It passes the time.
SHERLOCK, But if I do this ...
SHERLOCK," If you press a key card against your mobile phone for long enough, it corrupts the magnetic strip. The card stops working. It’s a common problem – never put your key card with your phone."
SHERLOCK, What happens if I use the card now?
JOHN, It still doesn’t work.
SHERLOCK, But it doesn’t read as the wrong card now.
SHERLOCK," It registers as corrupted. But if it’s corrupted, how do they know it’s not Magnussen?"
SHERLOCK, Would they risk dragging him off?
JOHN, Probably not.
SHERLOCK, So what do they do? What do they have to do?
JOHN, Check if it’s him or not.
SHERLOCK, There’s a camera at eye height to the right of the door.
SHERLOCK, A live picture of the card user is relayed directly to Magnussen’s personal staff in his office – the only people trusted to make a positive ID.
SHERLOCK," ... at this hour, almost certainly his PA."
JOHN, S-so how’s that help us?
SHERLOCK, Human error. (He raises his hand to the breast pocket of his coat and pats it.) I’ve been shopping.
SHERLOCK," Here we go, then."
JOHN, Hang on – was that ...? That ...!
SHERLOCK," Hi, Janine. (Secretively, glancing around) Go on, let me in."
JANINE, I can’t! You know I can’t. Don’t be silly.
JANINE, Do what in front of everyone?
SHERLOCK," You see? As long as there’s people, there’s always a weak spot."
JOHN, That was Janine.
SHERLOCK," Yes, of course it was Janine. She’s Magnussen’s PA. That’s the whole point."
JOHN, Did you just get engaged to break into an office?
SHERLOCK," Yeah. (He steps into the lift.) Stroke of luck, meeting her at your wedding. You can take some of the credit."
JOHN, Je-Jesus!
s note," thanks to ‘Hobbitfoot’ on fanfiction.net who pointed out that in one of the earlier long shots while John and Sherlock are still some distance away from the lift, there’s a bin beside the lift. The bin disappears in the shots where they’re close to the lift but it does make more sense than John simply dropping the cups onto the floor.]"
JOHN, What are you gonna do?
SHERLOCK," Well, not actually marry her, obviously. (He looks round to him.) There’s only so far you can go."
JOHN, So what will you tell her?
SHERLOCK," Well, I’ll tell her that our entire relationship was a ruse to break into her boss’ office. I imagine she’ll want to stop seeing me at that point ... (he looks at John again) ... but you’re the expert on women."
JOHN, So where did she go?
SHERLOCK, It’s a bit rude. I just proposed to her.
JOHN, Sherlock ...
SHERLOCK, Did she faint? Do they really do that?
JOHN, It’s a blow to the head. (He bends lower to her.) She’s breathing. Janine?
SHERLOCK, Security.
JOHN, Does he need help?
SHERLOCK, Ex-con.
SHERLOCK," White supremacist, by the tattoo, so who cares? (He points back towards John.) Stick with Janine."
JOHN," Janine, focus on my voice now. Can you hear me?"

MAGNUSSEN, ... so English. What-what would he say to you now?
MAGNUSSEN," Nej, nej! [No, no!]"
SHERLOCK, ... Lady Smallwood.
MAGNUSSEN," That’s ... not ... Lady Smallwood, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK, He-he’s downstairs.
SHERLOCK," Mary, whatever he’s got on you, let me help."
SHERLOCK, Mary?
MOLLY," It’s tightly focussed, so there’s little or no energy transfer."
MOLLY, You stay still ...
MOLLY, ... and the bullet pushes through.
MOLLY," You’re almost certainly going to die, so we need to focus."
MOLLY, ... focus.
MOLLY," It’s all well and clever having a Mind Palace, but you’ve only three seconds of consciousness left to use it. So, come on – what’s going to kill you?"
SHERLOCK, Blood loss.
MOLLY," So, it’s all about one thing now."
MOLLY," Forwards, or backwards?"
ANDERSON," One hole, or two?"
MOLLY, Is the bullet still inside you ...
MOLLY, ... or is there an exit wound?
SHERLOCK," That one, I think."
SHERLOCK, Or that one.
MYCROFT, It doesn’t matter about the gun. Don’t be stupid.
MYCROFT, You always were so stupid.
MYCROFT, Such a disappointment.
MYCROFT, Mummy and Daddy are very cross ...
MYCROFT, ... because it doesn’t matter about the gun.
MYCROFT, You saw the whole room when you entered it. What was directly behind you when you were murdered?
SHERLOCK, The mirror shattering.
MYCROFT, You didn’t. Therefore ...?
SHERLOCK, The bullet’s still inside me.
MOLLY, ... you need to fall on your back.
SHERLOCK, What the hell is that? What’s happening?
MOLLY, It’s the next thing that’s going to kill you.
SHERLOCK, What do I do?
MYCROFT," Don’t go into shock, obviously."
MYCROFT, Must be something in this ridiculous memory palace of yours that can calm you down.
MYCROFT, Find it.
s VOICE, Find it.
SHERLOCK," Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy. Come on!"
SHERLOCK, Come to me. It’s okay. It’s all right.
YOUNG SHERLOCK," Come on! It’s me! It’s me, come on!"
SHERLOCK, Come on!
YOUNG SHERLOCK, Good boy! Clever boy!
SHERLOCK," Hello, Redbeard. They’re putting me down too, now. It’s no fun, is it?"
MOLLY, There’s a hole ripped through you. Massive internal bleeding.
MOLLY, You have to control the pain.
SHERLOCK, Control! Control! Control.
SHERLOCK," You never felt pain, did you? Why did you never feel pain?"
JIM, But you don’t have to fear it!
JIM, Pain. Heartbreak. Loss.
s VOICE, Sherlock?
JOHN, Sherlock?
JOHN, Can you hear me?
JOHN, What happened?
JOHN," Sherlock! Oh, my ..."
JOHN, Who shot him?
JIM," ♪ It’s raining, it’s pouring. Sherlock is boring ... ♪"
JOHN, Sherlock.
JOHN, We’re losing you. Sherlock?
JIM," One little push, and off you pop."
JIM," You’re gonna love being dead, Sherlock."
JIM, No-one ever bothers you.
JIM, ... and The Woman will cry; and John will cry buckets and buckets. It’s him that I worry about the most. That wife!
JIM," You’re letting him down, Sherlock. John Watson is definitely in danger."
JIM," Was it something I said, huh?"
JIM, SHERLOCK!
 Sherlock sees a rapid montage of images," several moments from when Magnussen showed him the edge of the papers in his jacket pocket in 221B’s living room; then Mary aiming her gun down at Magnussen in his flat before Sherlock knew who the potential killer was; then the front door to 221B. His inner vision closes in on the door and settles on it. In the operating room, his eyelids begin to lift as the heart monitor’s blips become more regular. The surgeon looks down at him ... ... and Sherlock Holmes opens his eyes. His gaze becomes more focussed, and his mouth begins to close around the tube in his mouth in an attempt to form a word. As the scene switches to the next one, a soft whisper can be heard. SHERLOCK’s VOICE (offscreen, in a whisper): Mary.  [Your transcriber slumps sideways and falls off her chair, exhausted at having just typed the most intense and complicated seven minutes of footage that she has ever attempted. She lies on the floor giggling contentedly to herself for a few minutes, then wearily hauls herself back onto her chair and gets back to work.] "
JOHN, Mary.
MARY, Hey.
JOHN," Oh, you, Mrs Watson ... (he points at her, trying to look stern) ... you’re in big trouble."
MARY, Really? Why?
JOHN, His first word when he woke up?
JOHN, “Mary”!
MARY, Ahh!
MARY, You don’t tell John.
JANINE, I’m buying a cottage.
JANINE," I made a lot of money out of you, mister."
JANINE, Nothing hits the spot like revenge for profits.
JANINE," God, no – one of his rivals. He was spittin’!"
SHERLOCK," And you – as it turns out – are a grasping, opportunistic, publicity-hungry tabloid whore."
SHERLOCK," Yeah, of course. (He smiles.) Where’s the cottage?"
JANINE, Sussex Downs.
SHERLOCK," Hmm, nice."
JANINE," It’s gorgeous. There’s beehives, but I’m getting rid of those."
JANINE," Aw, hurts, does it? Probably wanna restart your morphine. I might have fiddled with the taps."
SHERLOCK, How much more revenge are you gonna need?
JANINE, Just the occasional top-up.
JANINE," Dream come true for you, this place. They actually attach the drugs to you!"
SHERLOCK, Not good for working.
JANINE," You won’t be working for a while, Sherl."
SHERLOCK, I exploited the fact of our connection.
JANINE, When?!
SHERLOCK, Hmm?
JANINE, Just once would have been nice.
SHERLOCK, Oh. (He looks a little shifty-eyed.) I was waiting until we got married.
JANINE, That was never gonna happen!
JANINE, Got to go.
JANINE, I’m not supposed to keep you talking.
JANINE, Just one thing.
JANINE, You shouldn’t have lied to me. I know what kind of man you are ... but we could have been friends.
JANINE, I’ll give your love to John and Mary.
MARY, You don’t tell John.
SHERLOCK, ... Mary Watson. Who are you?
JOHN," Dunno how much sense you’ll get out of him. He’s drugged up, so he’s pretty much babbling."
JOHN," Oh, they won’t let you use that in here, you know."
LESTRADE," No, I’m not gonna use the phone. I just wanna take a video."
JOHN," Oh, Jesus."
LESTRADE, He’s got three known bolt holes ...
LESTRADE," Parliament Hill, Camden Lock and Dagmar Court."
MYCROFT, Five known bolt holes.
MYCROFT, There’s the blind greenhouse in Kew Gardens and the leaning tomb in Hampstead Cemetery.
MOLLY, Just the spare bedroom. ... (Awkwardly) Well ... my bedroom. We agreed he needs the space.
MRS HUDSON, Behind the clock face of Big Ben.
JOHN, I think he was probably joking.
MRS HUDSON, No! I don’t think so!
ANDERSON, Leinster Gardens. That’s his number one bolt hole. It’s top-top secret.
ANDERSON, Followed!
BENJI," Followed, yeah."
JOHN, He knew who shot him.
JOHN," The bullet wound was here, so he was facing whoever it was."
LESTRADE, Because he’s tracking them down himself.
LESTRADE, Protecting the shooter? Why?
JOHN," Well, protecting someone, then. But why would he care? He’s Sherlock. Who would he bother protecting?"
LESTRADE," Call me if you hear anything. Don’t hold out on me, John."
LESTRADE," Call me, okay?"
LESTRADE," Good night, then."
MRS HUDSON, Oh ...
MRS HUDSON, John? Need a cuppa.
JOHN, Mrs Hudson ... (he clears his throat) ... wh-why does Sherlock think that I’ll be moving back in here?
MRS HUDSON," Oh, yes, he’s put your chair back again, hasn’t he?"
JOHN," Huh. (He sits back in the chair again, still looking at it thoughtfully.)"
MRS HUDSON, That’s nice!
MRS HUDSON, Looks much better.
MRS HUDSON," John, what’s wrong? Tell me."
MRS HUDSON, John?
MRS HUDSON," That’s your phone, isn’t it?"
MRS HUDSON," It’s Sherlock, John. It’s Sherlock."
MRS HUDSON, John! You have to answer it!
BILL, ... ’e finds you.
MARY, You’re working for Sherlock now.
BILL," Keeps me off the streets, dunnit?"
MARY, Well ... no.
MARY," Well, what am I looking for?"
MARY, How did you know I’d come here?
MARY, What am I looking at?
MARY," What do you want, Sherlock?"
MARY," At first I thought it was just a Bible thing, you know, spam, but it’s not. It’s a skip-code."
JOHN, How can you not remember which room? You remember everything.
MARY, Two oh seven.
MARY, You were very slow.
MARY, How badly do you want to find out?
SHERLOCK, May I see?
MARY, It’s a dummy.
MARY, I suppose it was a fairly obvious trick.
SHERLOCK," And yet, over a distance of six feet, you failed to make a kill shot."
SHERLOCK, Enough to hospitalise me; not enough to kill me. That wasn’t a miss.
SHERLOCK, That was surgery.
SHERLOCK, I’ll take the case.
SHERLOCK, Yours. (A little angrily) Why didn’t you come to me in the first place? 
MARY," Because John can’t ever know that I lied to him. It would break him and I would lose him forever – and, Sherlock, I will never let that happen."
MARY, Please ...
MARY, ... understand. There is nothing in this world that I would not do to stop that happening.
SHERLOCK, Not that obvious a trick.
MRS HOLMES," Mikey, is this your laptop?"
MYCROFT," On which depends the security of the free world, yes ... (he smiles rather sarcastically up at her) ... and you’ve got potatoes on it."
MYCROFT, Why are we doing this? We never do this.
MRS HOLMES, We are here because Sherlock is home from hospital and we are all very happy.
MYCROFT, Am I happy too? I haven’t checked.
MYCROFT," ‘Mycroft’ is the name you gave me, if you could possibly struggle all the way to the end. "
BILL, Mrs Holmes?
MRS HOLMES," Oh! Thank you, dear."
MRS HOLMES, Not absolutely sure why you’re here.
SHERLOCK, I invited him.
BILL," I’m his protégé, Mrs ’olmes. When ’e dies, I get all his stuff, an’ ’is job."
BILL," Oh. Well, I help out a bit."
SHERLOCK, Closer.
BILL, If ’e does get murdered or something ...
BILL, Okay.
MRS HOLMES, Ah. This was for Mary. (She walks away with whatever it is.) I’ll be back in a minute.
MRS HOLMES," Ah, Mary."
MRS HOLMES, There you are.
MRS HOLMES," Cup of tea. Now, if Father starts making little humming noises, just give him a little poke. That usually does it."
MRS HOLMES," Oh, that silly old thing. You mustn’t read that. Mathematics must seem terribly fatuous now!"
MR HOLMES," Complete flake, my wife, but happens to be a genius."
MARY, She was a mathematician?
MR HOLMES, Gave it all up for children.
MR HOLMES," I could never bear to argue with her. I’m something of a moron myself. But she’s ... (he glances away briefly, then looks back to Mary and leans closer to her, smiling) ... unbelievably hot!"
JOHN, Oh.
JOHN," Sorry. I-I just, er ..."
MR HOLMES," Oh. Er-er, do you two need a moment?"
JOHN, If you don’t mind.
MR HOLMES, Those two. They all right?
MRS HUDSON, John.
MRS HUDSON, Mary!
SHERLOCK, Get me some morphine from your kitchen. I’ve run out.
MRS HUDSON, I don’t have any morphine!
MRS HUDSON, What is going on?
JOHN, Bloody good question.
JOHN," Oh, I have a better question."
JOHN, Is everyone I’ve ever met a psychopath?
SHERLOCK," Good that we’ve settled that. Anyway, we ..."
MRS HUDSON, Oh!
SHERLOCK, I didn’t say it was funny.
JOHN, You.
JOHN, What have I ever done ... hmm? ... my whole life ... to deserve you? 
SHERLOCK," That’s me, by the way. (He raises his left hand and waves at him.) Hello. "
SHERLOCK, Even the landlady used to run a drug cartel.
MRS HUDSON, It was my husband’s cartel. I was just typing.
MRS HUDSON," Sherlock Holmes, if you’ve been YouTube-ing ..."
SHERLOCK, Because you chose her.
JOHN," Why is everything ... (he walks towards the dining table, holding up a questioning hand and shrugging) ... always ... (his voice raises to a loud shout) ... MY FAULT?!"
MRS HUDSON," Oh, the neighbours!"
SHERLOCK, No. What is she?
SHERLOCK," No. Not in this flat; not in this room. Right here, right now, what is she?"
JOHN, Okay.
JOHN, Always your way.
JOHN, Sit.
MARY, Why?
JOHN," ... the people who come in here with their stories. Th-the clients – that’s all you are now, Mary. You’re a client. This is where you sit and talk ... (he gestures towards the armchairs) ... and this is where we sit and listen, then we decide if we want you or not."
JOHN," So, are you okay?"
MARY, Now?
MARY, Seriously? Months of silence and we’re gonna do this ... (she nods towards the drive) ... now?
SHERLOCK, ‘A.G.R.A.’ What’s that?
MARY, Er ... my initials.
MARY," Everything about who I was is on there. (Directly to John) If you love me, don’t read it in front of me."
MARY, ... and I don’t want to see that happen.
MARY, How much d’you know already?
SHERLOCK," ... Magnussen knows your secret, which is why you were going to kill him; and I assume you befriended Janine ... (he grimaces, shifting uncomfortably on his chair) ... in order to get close to him."
MARY, Oh – you can talk!
JOHN, Ohhh. Look at you two.
JOHN, You should have got married.
MARY," The stuff Magnussen has on me, I would go to prison for the rest of my life."
JOHN, So you were just gonna kill him.
MARY, People like Magnussen should be killed. That’s why there are people like me.
JOHN, How could I not see that?
MARY, You did see that.
MARY, Because he’s right.
SHERLOCK, So ... Mary ...
SHERLOCK," ... any documents that Magnussen has concerning yourself, you want ... (he grimaces yet again, his voice tight as if with physical pain) ... extracted and returned."
MARY, Why would you help me?
SHERLOCK, Because ... you saved my life.
JOHN," Sor-sorry, what?"
SHERLOCK, ... you had a problem.
s note," In the original version of this scene, Magnussen said, “Kill us both?”]"
s note," Sherlock does say ‘bide,’ though I suspect that Benedict ought to have said ‘buy.’ However, note an alternative theory here]"
JOHN, How did she save your life?
SHERLOCK, She phoned the ambulance.
JOHN, I phoned the ambulance.
SHERLOCK, She phoned first.
PARAMEDIC, Did somebody call an ambulance?
SHERLOCK, ... eight minutes. 
SHERLOCK, Did you bring any morphine? I asked on the phone.
SHERLOCK," There was, last week ..."
SHERLOCK, ... but I believe I’m bleeding internally and my pulse is very erratic.
SHERLOCK, You may need to re-start my heart on the way.
JOHN," Come on, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK, John?
SHERLOCK, John – Magnussen is all that matters now. You can trust Mary. She saved my life.
SHERLOCK," Er, mixed messages, I grant you."
JOHN," Sherlock? Sherlock. (To the paramedics) All right, take him."
JOHN, Got him?
MARY," So, have you read it?"
JOHN, W-would you come here a moment?
MARY," No, I’m fine."
JOHN, I’ve thought long and hard about what I want to say to you.
JOHN," These are prepared words, Mary."
JOHN, I’ve chosen these words with care.
JOHN, It’s all I have to say. It’s all I need to know.
JOHN, Is ‘Mary Watson’ good enough for you?
JOHN," Then it’s good enough for me, too."
MARY, Oh!
JOHN, All this does not mean that I’m not still basically pissed off with you.
JOHN," I am very pissed off, and it will come out now and then."
MARY," I know, I know, I know."
MARY, I do mow the lawn.
JOHN," No, I do it loads."
MARY, You really don’t.
JOHN, I choose the baby’s name.
MARY, Not a chance.
JOHN, Okay.
MYCROFT, I’m glad you’ve given up on the Magnussen business.
SHERLOCK, Are you?
MYCROFT," He never causes too much damage to anyone important. He’s far too intelligent for that. He’s a business-man, that’s all, and occasionally useful to us. A necessary evil – not a dragon for you to slay."
SHERLOCK, A dragon slayer. Is that what you think of me?
MYCROFT, No!
MYCROFT," I have, by the way, a job offer I should like you to decline."
SHERLOCK, I decline your kind offer.
MYCROFT, I shall pass on your regrets.
SHERLOCK, What was it?
MYCROFT," MI6 – they want to place you back into Eastern Europe. An undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in, I think, about six months."
SHERLOCK, Then why don’t you want me to take it?
SHERLOCK, Utility(!) How do I have utility?
MYCROFT, “Here be dragons.”
MYCROFT, This isn’t agreeing with me. I’m going in.
SHERLOCK, You need low tar. You still smoke like a beginner.
SHERLOCK, What the hell am I supposed to say to that?!
SHERLOCK, You hate Christmas.
SHERLOCK, Clearly. Go and have some more.
MARY," So you realise that, er, Sherlock got us out here to see his mum and dad for a reason?"
JOHN, Oi. (He frowns round to the side of her head.) Oi.
JOHN, Mary? Jesus Christ. Mary?
JOHN, Sit down.
JOHN," Mary, can you hear me?"
SHERLOCK, Don’t drink Mary’s tea.
JOHN, Sherlock?
BILL, I calculated your wife’s dose meself. Won’t affect the little one. I’ll keep an eye on ’er.
SHERLOCK, ... A deal with the devil.
MAGNUSSEN, Shouldn’t you be in hospital?
MAGNUSSEN, Is it?
SHERLOCK," In my opinion, yes."
SHERLOCK, Have a seat.
MAGNUSSEN, Thank you.
SHERLOCK, I’ve been thinking about you.
MAGNUSSEN, I’ve been thinking about you.
SHERLOCK, Really?
MAGNUSSEN, What makes you think I’d be so careless?
SHERLOCK, It’s the dead-eye stare that gives it away.
SHERLOCK, You’re reading.
SHERLOCK," Portable Appledore. (He briefly snorts, then looks across to Magnussen.) How does it work?"
SHERLOCK, Built-in flash drive? (He lifts the glasses towards his own face.) 4G wireless?
SHERLOCK, They’re just ordinary spectacles.
MAGNUSSEN, Yes – they are.
PRESSURE POINT, > MORPHINE (ADD TO FILE)
MAGNUSSEN," You underestimate me, Mr Holmes."
MAGNUSSEN, Are you making me an offer?
SHERLOCK, A Christmas present.
MAGNUSSEN," And what are you giving me for Christmas, Mr Holmes?"
SHERLOCK, My brother.
JOHN, Sherlock ...
SHERLOCK, I’d rather keep you guessing.
SHERLOCK, Ah. (He smiles.) There’s our lift.
JOHN, Where?
SHERLOCK, D’you want your wife to be safe?
JOHN," Yeah, of course I do."
SHERLOCK," Good, because this is going to be incredibly dangerous. (Quick fire, speaking on one single breath for the next two sentences) One false move and we’ll have betrayed the security of the United Kingdom and be in prison for high treason. Magnussen is quite simply the most dangerous man we’ve ever encountered, and the odds are comprehensively stacked against us."
SHERLOCK, I feel the same.
SHERLOCK," Oh, you mean it’s actually Christmas. Did you bring your gun as I suggested?"
JOHN, Why would I bring my gun to your parents’ house for Christmas dinner?!
SHERLOCK," Off we go, then."
JOHN, Where are we going?
SHERLOCK, Appledore.
MAGNUSSEN," Yes, of course."
MAGNUSSEN," Very hard to find a pressure point on you, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK, Mm.
MAGNUSSEN, The drugs thing I never believed for a moment.
MAGNUSSEN," Anyway, you wouldn’t care if it was exposed, would you?"
MAGNUSSEN, Your damsel in distress.
JOHN," You ... (he walks closer to Magnussen, his voice tight and furious) ... put me in a fire ... for leverage?"
MAGNUSSEN," Oh, I’d never let you burn, Doctor Watson. (He sits up and puts his glass onto the clear glass table in front of him, then looks up at John again.) I had people standing by."
MAGNUSSEN, I’m not a murderer ... unlike your wife.
MAGNUSSEN," Let me explain how leverage works, Doctor Watson."
MAGNUSSEN," Mycroft’s pressure point is his junkie detective brother, Sherlock."
MAGNUSSEN," And Sherlock’s pressure point is his best friend, John Watson. John Watson’s pressure point is his wife. I own John Watson’s wife ... (he looks round to Sherlock) ... I own Mycroft. (He sits down.) He’s what I’m getting for Christmas."
SHERLOCK," It’s an exchange, not a gift."
MAGNUSSEN," Forgive me, but ... (he holds the laptop to his chest and runs his fingers over the back) ... I already seem to have it."
SHERLOCK, It’s password protected.
SHERLOCK," In return for the password, you will give me any material in your possession pertaining to the woman I know as Mary Watson."
MAGNUSSEN," Oh, she’s bad, that one. So many dead people. You should see what I’ve seen."
JOHN, I don’t need to see it.
MAGNUSSEN," You might enjoy it, though."
MAGNUSSEN, I enjoy it.
MAGNUSSEN, Show you Appledore?
MAGNUSSEN, The secret vaults? Is that what you want?
MAGNUSSEN," You know, I honestly expected something good."
SHERLOCK," Oh, I think you’ll find the contents of that laptop ..."
MAGNUSSEN," ... include a GPS locator. By now, your brother will have noticed the theft, and security services will be converging on this house. Having arrived ... (he looks down at the laptop) ... they’ll find top secret information in my hands ... (he reaches forward and picks up his glass from the table) ... and have every justification to search my vaults. They will discover further information of this kind and I’ll be imprisoned. You will be exonerated, and restored to your smelly little apartment to solve crimes with Mr and Mrs Psychopath."
SHERLOCK, The fact that you know it’s going to happen isn’t going to stop it.
MAGNUSSEN, Then why am I smiling?
MAGNUSSEN, Ask me.
MAGNUSSEN, ... and everything he holds dear.
MAGNUSSEN, Let me show you the Appledore vaults.
MAGNUSSEN, The entrance to my vaults. This is where I keep you all.
JOHN," Okay – so where are the vaults, then?"
MAGNUSSEN, They’re all in here.
MAGNUSSEN," The Appledore vaults are my Mind Palace. You know about Mind Palaces, don’t you, Sherlock?"
MAGNUSSEN," How to store information so you never forget it – by picturing it. I just sit here, I close my eyes ... (he does so, slowly lowering his head) ... and down I go to my vaults."
MAGNUSSEN, ... my memories.
MAGNUSSEN, I’ll look at the files on Mrs Watson.
MAGNUSSEN," Mmm, ah. (In the white room he lifts his right hand as if lifting a folder out of the drawer.) This is one of my favourites. (He sits back in the chair while, in his head, he looks at the file with a picture of Mary paper-clipped to the inside.) Oh, it’s so exciting."
MAGNUSSEN, All those wet jobs for the CIA. Ooh!
MAGNUSSEN, She’s gone a bit ... freelance now. Bad girl.
MAGNUSSEN," Ah, she is so wicked."
MAGNUSSEN, I can really see why you like her.
MAGNUSSEN, You see?
JOHN, So there are no documents. You don’t actually have anything here.
MAGNUSSEN," Oh, sometimes I send out for something ... (he lifts his left hand and looks down at his watch) ... if I really need it ..."
MAGNUSSEN, ... but mostly I just remember it all.
MAGNUSSEN, You should have that on a T-shirt.
JOHN, You just remember it all?
JOHN," But if you just know it, then you don’t have proof."
MAGNUSSEN," Proof? What would I need proof for? I’m in news, you moron. I don’t have to prove it – I just have to print it."
MAGNUSSEN, Let’s go outside. They’ll be here shortly.
MAGNUSSEN, Can’t wait to see you arrested.
MAGNUSSEN," They’re taking their time, aren’t they?"
JOHN, I still don’t understand.
MAGNUSSEN, Bring it over here a minute.
MAGNUSSEN, Come on.
MAGNUSSEN, Lean forward a bit and stick your face out.
MAGNUSSEN," Now, can I flick it?"
MAGNUSSEN, Can I flick your face?
MAGNUSSEN, I just love doing this.
MAGNUSSEN, I could do it all day.
MAGNUSSEN," It works like this, John. I know who Mary hurt and killed."
MAGNUSSEN, I know where they live; I know their phone numbers.
MAGNUSSEN, All in my Mind Palace – all of it.
MAGNUSSEN, ... just because I know.
MAGNUSSEN, Can I do your eye now?
MAGNUSSEN," See if you can keep it open, hmm?"
MAGNUSSEN, Come on. For Mary. Keep it open.
JOHN, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK, Just ... let him.
MAGNUSSEN," Here we go, Mr Holmes! "
 To clarify," Appledore’s vaults only exist in your mind, nowhere else, just there. "
MAGNUSSEN," Sorry. No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK, I’m not a hero ...
SHERLOCK, ... I’m a high-functioning sociopath.
SHERLOCK, Merry Christmas!
JOHN," Oh, Christ, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK, Give my love to Mary.
SHERLOCK, Tell her she’s safe now.
MYCROFT," As my colleague is fond of remarking, this country sometimes needs a blunt instrument. Equally, it sometimes needs a dagger – a scalpel wielded with precision and without remorse."
MYCROFT, There will always come a time when we need Sherlock Holmes.
SIR EDWIN, If this is some expression of familial sentiment ...
MYCROFT, Don’t be absurd. I am not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
MYCROFT, You know what happened to the other one.
MYCROFT," In any event, there is no prison in which we could incarcerate Sherlock without causing a riot on a daily basis. The alternative, however ..."
MYCROFT, ... would require your approval.
LADY SMALLWOOD," Hardly merciful, Mr Holmes."
MYCROFT," Regrettably, Lady Smallwood, my brother is a murderer."
MARY," Oh ... (she puts her hands on his shoulders and they kiss each other’s cheeks, then hug) ... don’t worry. I’ll keep him in trouble."
SHERLOCK, That’s my girl.
SHERLOCK, Since this is likely to be the last conversation I’ll have with John Watson ...
SHERLOCK, ... would you mind if we took a moment?
JOHN," So, here we are."
SHERLOCK, William Sherlock Scott Holmes.
JOHN, Sorry?
SHERLOCK, That’s the whole of it – if you’re looking for baby names.
JOHN," No, we’ve had a scan. We’re pretty sure it’s a girl."
JOHN, The game is over.
JOHN, What’s that?
SHERLOCK, It’s a story my brother told me when we were kids. The East Wind – this terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path.
SHERLOCK, It seeks out the unworthy ... (he meets John’s eyes) ... and plucks them from the Earth. That was generally me.
JOHN, Nice(!)
SHERLOCK, He was a rubbish big brother.
JOHN," So what about you, then? (He lifts his head.) Where are you actually going now?"
JOHN, For how long?
JOHN, And then what?
SHERLOCK, Who knows?
SHERLOCK," John, there’s something ... I should say; I-I’ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now."
SHERLOCK, Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.
JOHN, It’s not.
JOHN, We’re not naming our daughter after you.
SHERLOCK, I think it could work.
SHERLOCK," To the very best of times, John."
COMMENTATOR, Smith brings it inside. This looks good.
CUSTOMER," Oi! What’s up with the telly? There’s something wrong with the telly, mate!"
ANOTHER CUSTOMER," Give it a whack, then!"
CUSTOMER, Who’s that?
VOICE, Did you miss me?
LADY SMALLWOOD, How is this possible?
LADY SMALLWOOD, Has the Prime Minister been told? (She looks round and up to Sir Edwin.) And Mycroft?
MAN, It’s your brother.
SHERLOCK, Mycroft?
SHERLOCK, I’ve only been gone four minutes.
SHERLOCK," Oh, for God’s sake. Make up your mind. Who needs me this time?"
MARY," But he’s dead. I mean, you told me he was dead, Moriarty."
JOHN, Absolutely. He blew his own brains out.
MARY, So how can he be back?
JOHN, There’s an East Wind coming.
JIM, Miss me?
SHERLOCK, Afternoon!
MOLLY," Bad day, was it?"
MYCROFT, Since yesterday you’ve moved in with him ... 
MYCROFT, ... and now you’re solving crimes together.
MRS HUDSON," Look at you, all happy. It’s not decent."
SHERLOCK," Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!"
SHERLOCK," Don’t make people into heroes, John. Heroes don’t exist and if they did, I wouldn’t be one of them."
JOHN," Right, this should do it."
JOHN, Are you wearing any pants?
SHERLOCK, No.
JOHN, Okay.
IRENE, This is how I want you to remember me: the woman who beat you.
SHERLOCK, But there never was any monster.
JOHN, Sherlock?
JIM, Here we are at last.
SHERLOCK," Goodbye, John."
LESTRADE," Ooh, you bastard!"
SHERLOCK, ... just the two of us against the rest of the world.
JOHN, Wait! We’re going to need to co-ordinate.
JOHN, I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead.
SHERLOCK, I heard you.
JOHN, Shut up. You are not a puzzle solver; you never have been. You’re a drama queen. Now there is a man in there about to die ... 
MAGNUSSEN," No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK, I’m a high-functioning sociopath.
SHERLOCK," To the very best of times, John."
LADY SMALLWOOD, How is this possible?
SHERLOCK, I’ve only been gone four minutes.
MYCROFT," Well, I certainly hope you’ve learned your lesson."
SHERLOCK, Who needs me this time?
JIM, Miss me?
SOLDIER," You all right, Captain?"
STAMFORD, Watson!
STAMFORD, Stamford. Remember?
STAMFORD, We were at Bart’s together.
WATSON," Yes, of course. (He shakes hands with the other man.) Stamford."
STAMFORD, Good Lord! Where have you been? You’re as thin as a rake!
WATSON, I made it home. Many weren’t so lucky.
STAMFORD, So what now?
WATSON," Hmm? I need a place to live. Somewhere decent, and an affordable price. It’s not easy."
STAMFORD," You know, you’re the second person to say that to me today."
WATSON, Hmm? Who was the first?
WATSON, Good Lord!
STAMFORD," It’s an experiment, apparently. Beating corpses to establish how long after death bruising is still possible."
WATSON, Is there a medical point to that?
WATSON," Neither am I. So, where’s this friend of yours, then?"
HOLMES," You’ve been in Afghanistan, I perceive. (He turns away, reaching into his waistcoat for his pocket watch.)"
STAMFORD," Doctor Watson, Mr Sherlock ..."
WATSON, I’m sorry?
HOLMES, I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent’s Park. Between us we could afford them.
WATSON, Rooms? (He glances briefly at Stamford.) Who said anything about rooms?
HOLMES," Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a hanging in Wandsworth and I’d hate them to start without me."
WATSON, A hanging?
HOLMES, I take a professional interest. I also play the violin and smoke a pipe. I presume that’s not a problem?
WATSON," Er, no, well ..."
HOLMES," Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is two hundred and twenty-one B Baker Street."
NEWS VENDOR, Papers! Papers!
NEWS VENDOR, Papers! Papers!
WATSON, Here.
WATSON, How’s ‘The Blue Carbuncle’ doing?
NEWS VENDOR," Very popular, Doctor Watson. Is there gonna be a proper murder next time?"
WATSON, I’ll have a word with the criminal classes.
NEWS VENDOR, If you wouldn’t mind.
NEWS VENDOR, Is that ’im? Is ’e in there?
WATSON," No. No, no, not at all. (He tips a finger to his hat.) Ah, good day to you."
NEWS VENDOR," Merry Christmas, Mr Holmes!"
MRS HUDSON," Mr Holmes, I do wish you’d let me know when you’re planning to come home."
HOLMES," I hardly knew myself, Mrs Hudson. That’s the trouble with dismembered country squires – they’re notoriously difficult to schedule."
WATSON, Never mind.
HOLMES, Caught the murderer; still looking for the legs. Think we’ll call it a draw.
MRS HUDSON," And I notice you’ve published another of your stories, Doctor Watson."
WATSON, Yes. Did you enjoy it?
WATSON, Oh?
MRS HUDSON, I never enjoy them.
MRS HUDSON," Well, I never say anything, do I? According to you, I just show people up the stairs and serve you breakfasts."
MRS HUDSON, My what?!
HOLMES," Don’t feel singled out, Mrs Hudson. I’m hardly in the dog one."
MRS HUDSON," I’m your landlady, not a plot device."
WATSON," Would you, er, care to sit down?"
HOLMES," Well, why didn’t you ask her?"
HOLMES," Oh, for God’s sake. (Quietly, to Watson) Give her some lines. She’s perfectly capable of starving us."
HOLMES," Good afternoon. I’m Sherlock Holmes. This is my friend and colleague, Doctor Watson. You may speak freely in front of him, as he rarely understands a word."
WATSON, Holmes.
HOLMES, You have an impish sense of humour which currently you’re deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.
HOLMES, You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals. You have come to this agency as a last resort in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible.
WATSON," Good Lord, Holmes!"
HOLMES," All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume."
WATSON, Her perfume?
HOLMES," Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you."
WATSON, How so?
WATSON, Mary!
WATSON," Why, in God’s name, are you pretending to be a client?"
MRS WATSON," Because I could think of no other way to see my husband, Husband."
WATSON, It was an affair of international intrigue. 
MRS WATSON, It was a murdered country squire.
WATSON," Nevertheless, matters were pressing."
MRS WATSON," I don’t mind you going, my darling. I mind you leaving me behind!"
WATSON, But what could you do?!
MRS WATSON," Oh, what do you do except wander round, taking notes, looking surprised ..."
HOLMES, Enough!
MRS WATSON, Begin what?
HOLMES," Sometimes, to solve a case, one must first solve another."
WATSON," Oh, you have a case, then, a new one?"
WATSON, Deep? Into what?
HOLMES, Lestrade! Do stop loitering by the door and come in.
LESTRADE, How did you know it was me?
HOLMES, I fear she’s branched into literary criticism by means of satire. It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady. What brings you here in your off-duty hours?
LESTRADE, How’d you know I’m off-duty?
HOLMES," Well, since your arrival you’ve addressed over forty percent of your remarks to my decanter."
HOLMES," Watson, give the inspector what he so clearly wants."
WATSON," So, Lestrade, what can we do for you?"
LESTRADE," Oh, I’m not here on business. I just thought I’d ... drop by."
WATSON, A social call? (He walks over and hands Lestrade the glass.)
LESTRADE," Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season."
LESTRADE, Merry Christmas?
HOLMES, Merry Christmas.
WATSON, Merry Christmas.
MRS WATSON, Merry Christmas.
HOLMES," Thank God that’s over. Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door but embarrasses you to relate?"
LESTRADE, Who said anything happened?
HOLMES," You did, by every means short of actual speech."
WATSON, He didn’t want a drink ... (he takes the glass from Lestrade and turns it upside down to show that it is empty) ... he needed one. He’s not embarrassed; he’s afraid.
HOLMES, My Boswell is learning. They do grow up so fast.
HOLMES," Watson, restore the courage of Scotland Yard."
HOLMES," Inspector, do sit down."
HOLMES, Fear is wisdom in the face of danger. It is nothing to be ashamed of.
LESTRADE, Thank you.
HOLMES," From the beginning, then."
BRIDE, You!
GILES, No! Please!
BRIDE, You?!
HOLMES, A moment.
HOLMES, When was this?
LESTRADE, Yesterday morning.
HOLMES, The bride’s face. How was it described?
LESTRADE, White as death ...
LESTRADE, ... mouth like a crimson wound.
HOLMES, Poetry or truth?
LESTRADE, Many would say they’re the same thing.
LESTRADE, I saw her face myself. Afterwards.
HOLMES, After what?
BRIDE, You! (She pauses for a moment.) Or me?
HOLMES," Really, Lestrade. (He walks back across the room to sit in his chair.) A woman blows her own brains out in public and you need help identifying the guilty party. I fear Scotland Yard has reached a new low."
LESTRADE, That’s not why I’m here.
HOLMES, I surmise.
LESTRADE," Emelia Ricoletti. Yesterday was her wedding anniversary. The police, of course, were called, and her body taken to the morgue. (He drinks from his glass.)"
HOLMES, Standard procedure. Why are you telling us what may be presumed?
LESTRADE, Because of what happened next.
LESTRADE," Thomas Ricoletti, Emelia Ricoletti’s husband."
HOLMES, Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains.
LESTRADE," As it turned out, he was saved the trip."
BRIDE, ♪ Remember the maid ...
RICOLETTI, Who are you?
BRIDE, ♪ The maid of the mill. ♪ 
BRIDE," You recognise our song, my dear? I sang it at our wedding."
RICOLETTI, Emelia?! (He stutters.) You’re dead. You can’t be here. You died.
BRIDE," What does it look like, my handsome friend?"
BRIDE, It’s a shotgun wedding.
HOLMES," ’Til death us do part. Twice, in this case."
WATSON, Extraordinary.
MRS WATSON, Impossible!
HOLMES, ... which one can so rarely say of a morgue.
MRS WATSON, And am I just to sit here?
WATSON," Not at all, my dear. (He leans down and chucks her under the chin.) We’ll be hungry later!"
WATSON," Holmes, just one thing? (He looks down at his own clothes.) Tweeds, in a morgue?"
HOLMES," Needs must when the devil drives, Watson."
LESTRADE, Ma’am.
MRS WATSON, Votes for Women.
LESTRADE, And are you – are you for or against?
MRS HUDSON, Ooh-ooh!
MRS HUDSON," Oh. Have they gone off again, have they? I dunno – what a life those gentlemen lead."
MRS HUDSON," Oh, never you mind. Ooh, almost forgot."
MRS HUDSON, That came for you.
MRS WATSON, Oh!
MRS WATSON," Mrs Hudson, tell my husband I’ll be home late. I have some urgent business."
MRS HUDSON, Is everything all right?
MRS WATSON," Oh, you know, just a ... (she waves her hand vaguely and clears her throat) ... friend in need."
MRS HUDSON, Oh dear. What friend?
MRS WATSON, England.
MRS HUDSON," Well, that’s not very specific!"
HOLMES, Who’s on mortuary duty?
LESTRADE, You know who.
HOLMES, Please tell me which idiot did this!
ANDERSON, It’s for everyone’s safety.
WATSON, This woman is dead. Half her head is missing! She’s not a threat to anyone!
ANDERSON, Tell that to her husband. (He points across the room.) He’s under a sheet over there.
HOLMES," Whatever happened in Limehouse last night, I think we can safely assume it wasn’t the work of a dead woman."
ANDERSON, Stranger things have happened.
HOLMES, Such as?
WATSON, You’re speaking like a child.
THE NEW ARRIVAL, Holmes.
HOLMES, Hooper.
HOOPER, You – back to work.
HOOPER," So, come to astonish us with your magic tricks, I suppose."
HOLMES, Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention?
HOOPER," Nothing at all, Mr Holmes. You may leave any time you like."
LESTRADE," Doctor Hooper, I asked Mr Holmes to come here. Co-operate. That’s an order."
HOOPER," There are two ‘features of interest,’ as you are always saying in Doctor Watson’s stories."
HOLMES, I never say that.
WATSON," You do, actually, quite a lot."
HOOPER," First of all, this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti. She has been categorically identified. Beyond a doubt it is her."
WATSON, Then who was that in Limehouse last night?
HOOPER, That was also Emelia Ricoletti.
WATSON, It can’t have been. She was dead. She was here.
HOOPER, She was positively identified by her own husband seconds before he died. He had no reason to lie. He could hardly be mistaken.
LESTRADE, The cabbie knew her too. There’s no question it’s her.
WATSON," But she can’t have been in two places at the same time, can she?"
WATSON," Holmes, could it have been twins?"
HOLMES, No.
WATSON, Why not?
HOLMES, Because it’s never twins.
LESTRADE," Emelia was not a twin, nor did she have any sisters. She had one older brother who died four years ago."
WATSON, Maybe it was a secret twin.
HOLMES, A what?
WATSON, Hmm? You know? A twin that nobody knows about? This whole thing could have been planned.
HOLMES," Since the moment of conception? How breathtakingly prescient of her! It is never twins, Watson."
WATSON, Then what’s your theory?
LESTRADE, I-I don’t understand. What ...
HOLMES," Why were you so frightened? Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter, and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest?"
HOOPER, Ah. That would be the other feature of interest.
WATSON, Ah. A smear of blood on her finger. That could have happened any number of ways.
HOOPER, Indeed.
HOOPER, There’s one other thing. It wasn’t there earlier.
LESTRADE, And neither was that.
WATSON, Holmes!
WATSON," She, you mean."
WATSON," Not “he,” “she.”"
WATSON," Er, the gunshot wound was obviously the cause of death, but there are clear indicators of consumption. Might be worth a post mortem. We need all the information we can get."
HOOPER," Oh, isn’t he observant now that Daddy’s gone?"
ANDERSON, What’s he saying that for?
WATSON," Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory."
HOLMES," Not yet. These are deep waters, Watson. Deep waters. (He looks out of the window.) And I shall have to go deeper still."
LESTRADE," Five of them now, all the same, every one of ’em."
LESTRADE, What is?
HOLMES, The obliquity of the ecliptic. I have to understand it.
LESTRADE, What is it?
HOLMES, I don’t know. I’m still trying to understand it.
LESTRADE, I thought you understood everything.
HOLMES, Of course not. That would be an appalling waste of brain space. I specialise.
LESTRADE, Then what’s so important about this?
LESTRADE," They’re not boring! Five men dead! Murdered in their own homes; rice on the floor, like at a wedding; and the word “YOU” written in blood on the wall!"
LESTRADE," Uh, it’s-it’s her! It’s-it’s the Bride. Somehow she’s risen again!"
 There you are, solved.
HOLMES, Pay Mrs Hudson a visit on your way out. She likes to feel involved.
LESTRADE, You sure?
HOLMES, Certainly. Go away. (He turns and calls into the sitting room.) Watson! I’m ready. Get your hat and boots. We have an important appointment.
LESTRADE, Didn’t Doctor Watson move out a few months ago?
HOLMES," He did, didn’t he? (He looks thoughtful.) Who have I been talking to all this time?"
LESTRADE," Well, speaking on behalf of the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard, that chair is definitely empty."
HOLMES," It is, isn’t it? Works surprisingly well, though. I actually thought he was improving."
WATSON, Ah. Where have you been?
JANE," Sorry, sir. I’m rather behind my time this morning."
WATSON," Are you incapable of boiling an egg? (He sighs.) The fires are rarely lit; there is dust everywhere; and you almost destroyed my boots scraping the mud off them. If it wasn’t my wife’s business to deal with the staff, I would talk to you myself. Where is my wife?"
JANE," Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out."
WATSON, Out? At this hour of the morning?
JANE," Yes, sir. Did you not know that, sir?"
WATSON, Where did she go? (He looks down at his newspaper.) She’s always out these days.
JANE, ... sir.
WATSON, I’m sorry?
JANE," Just observing, sir."
WATSON," Well, that’s quite enough. Nobody asked you to be observant."
JANE," Sorry, sir. I just meant you’re hardly ever home together any more, sir."
WATSON, You are dangerously close to impertinence. (He leans forward.) I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you.
JANE," Very good, sir. And when will you be seeing her?"
WATSON, Now listen ...
JANE," Ooh, I nearly forgot, sir."
JANE," Er, a telegram came for you."
WATSON, You forgot?!
JANE," No, I nearly forgot."
JANE," Reading your new one in The Strand, sir."
WATSON, Did you enjoy it?
JANE," Why do you never mention me, sir?"
WATSON, Go away.
WATSON, The what of the what?
HOLMES, The obliquity of the ecliptic.
WATSON," “Come at once,” you said. I assumed it was important."
HOLMES, It is. It’s the inclination of the Earth’s equator to the path of the sun on the celestial plane.
WATSON, Have you been swotting up?
HOLMES, Why would I do that?
WATSON, To sound clever.
HOLMES, I am clever.
WATSON," Oh, I see."
HOLMES, You see what?
WATSON, I deduce we’re on our way to see someone cleverer than you.

WATSON, Oh.
MYCROFT HOLMES," To anyone who wishes to study mankind, this is the spot."
HOLMES," Handy, really, as your ever-expanding backside is permanently glued to it. Good morning, brother mine."
WATSON," You look ... well, sir."
MYCROFT HOLMES, Really? I rather thought I looked enormous.
WATSON," Well, now you mention it, this level of consumption is incredibly injurious to your health. Your heart ..."
HOLMES," No need to worry on that score, Watson."
WATSON, No?
HOLMES, There’s only a large cavity where that organ should reside.
MYCROFT HOLMES, It’s a family trait.
HOLMES," Oh, I wasn’t being critical."
WATSON," If you continue like this, sir, I give you five years at the most."
MYCROFT HOLMES," Five? We thought three, did we not, Sherlock?"
HOLMES, I’m still inclined to four.
MYCROFT HOLMES," As ever, you see but you do not observe. Note the discolouration in the whites of my eyes, the visible rings of fat around the corneas ..."
HOLMES," Yes, you’re right. I’m changing my bet to three years, four months and eleven days."
WATSON, A bet?!
HOLMES," I understand your disapproval, Watson, but if he’s feeling competitive it is perfectly within his power to die early."
MYCROFT HOLMES, That’s a risk you’ll have to take.
WATSON, You’re gambling with your own life? 
MYCROFT HOLMES, Why not? It’s so much more exciting than gambling with others’.
MYCROFT HOLMES, Done!
MYCROFT HOLMES, I expected to see you a few days ago about the Manor House case. I thought you might be a little out of your depth there.
MYCROFT HOLMES," It was Adams, of course."
HOLMES," Yes, it was Adams."
HOLMES, I know. I read it.
MYCROFT HOLMES, Did you understand it?
MYCROFT HOLMES, No – did you understand the murderous jealousy? It is no easy thing for a great mind to contemplate a still greater one.
HOLMES, Did you summon me here just to humiliate me?
MYCROFT HOLMES, Yes.
MYCROFT HOLMES," Of course not, but it is by far the greater pleasure."
HOLMES, Then would you mind explaining exactly why you did summon ...
WATSON, Socialists?
MYCROFT HOLMES," Not socialists, Doctor, no."
WATSON, Anarchists?
MYCROFT HOLMES, No.
WATSON, The French? The suffragists?
MYCROFT HOLMES, Is there any large body of people you’re not concerned about?
HOLMES, Doctor Watson is endlessly vigilant. (He looks at his brother.) Elaborate.
MYCROFT HOLMES, No. Investigate. This is a conjecture of mine and I need you to confirm it. I’m sending you a case.
WATSON, The Scots.
HOLMES, Scots?!
MYCROFT HOLMES, Are you aware of recent theories concerning what is known as ‘paranoia’?
WATSON," Ooh, sounds Serbian."
WATSON, But these enemies: how are we to defeat them if you won’t tell us about them?
MYCROFT HOLMES, We don’t defeat them. We must certainly lose to them.
WATSON, Why?
MYCROFT HOLMES," Because they are right, and we are wrong."
HOLMES, Lady Carmichael’s case – what is it?
MYCROFT HOLMES," Oh, rest assured, it has features of interest."
HOLMES, I never really say that.
WATSON, You really do.
MYCROFT HOLMES," Only in my head. I need you for the, er ... (he grimaces) ... legwork."
WATSON, Why not just tell us your solution?
MYCROFT HOLMES," Where would be the sport in that? Will you do it, Sherlock? I can promise you a superior distraction."
HOLMES, On one condition. Have another plum pudding.
MYCROFT HOLMES, There’s one on the way.
MYCROFT HOLMES, It’s getting exciting now!
MYCROFT HOLMES," Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock."
MYCROFT HOLMES," Thank you, Wilder."
WILDER," Also, Mr Melas to see you, Mr Holmes."
MYCROFT HOLMES, Ah. Give me five minutes. I have a wager to win.
MYCROFT HOLMES, Better make that fifteen.
MYCROFT HOLMES, Tick tock.
LADY CARMICHAEL," Mr Holmes, I have come here for advice."
HOLMES, That is easily got.
LADY CARMICHAEL, And help.
HOLMES, Not always so easy.
LADY CARMICHAEL," Something has happened, Mr Holmes – something ... unusual and ... terrifying."
HOLMES, Then you are in luck.
LADY CARMICHAEL, ‘Luck’?
HOLMES, This is really very promising.
WATSON, Holmes ...
HOLMES, Please do tell us what has so distressed you.
LADY CARMICHAEL," I – I thought long and hard as to what to do, but then, er, it occurred to me that my husband was an acquaintance of your brother and that, perhaps through him ..."
LADY CARMICHAEL," The fact is, I’m not sure this comes within your purview, Mr Holmes."
HOLMES, No?
LADY CARMICHAEL," Lord help me, I think it may be a matter for a priest."
SIR EUSTACE," And what does your morning threaten, my dear? (He takes a drink from his teacup.) A vigorous round of embroidering? An exhausting appointment at the milliner’s?"
LADY CARMICHAEL," I hope you are teasing, Eustace."
LADY CARMICHAEL, What is it?
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace?
LADY CARMICHAEL," Daniel, Sophie, go out and play."
SOPHIE, But Mama ...
LADY CARMICHAEL," Do as I tell you. Quickly, now."
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace! What does this mean?
LADY CARMICHAEL, What?
SIR EUSTACE, It means death.
SIR EUSTACE," Er, nothing. It’s, er, it’s nothing. I was mistaken."
LADY CARMICHAEL," My dear, you’ve gone quite pale."
SIR EUSTACE, It’s nothing.
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace ...
HOLMES, Did you keep the envelope?
LADY CARMICHAEL, My husband destroyed it ...
LADY CARMICHAEL, ... but it was blank. No name or address of any kind.
HOLMES, Tell me: has Sir Eustace spent time in America?
LADY CARMICHAEL, No.
HOLMES, Not even before your marriage?
LADY CARMICHAEL," Well, not to my knowledge."
HOLMES, Hmm. Pray continue with your fascinating narrative. (He steeples his hands in front of his mouth.)
LADY CARMICHAEL," Well, that incident took place last Monday morning. It was two days later, on the Wednesday, that my husband first saw her."
WATSON, Who?
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace?
SIR EUSTACE," She’s come for me, Louisa. Oh, God help me, my sins have found me out."
LADY CARMICHAEL, Who’s come for you?
LADY CARMICHAEL," Eustace, you’re frightening me."
SIR EUSTACE, Look! Look!
SIR EUSTACE, Don’t you see her?
LADY CARMICHAEL," No, no. I see no-one."
SIR EUSTACE, Gone.
LADY CARMICHAEL, You keep so many secrets from me. Is this another? Who have you seen?
SIR EUSTACE, It was her. It was the Bride.
HOLMES, And you saw nothing?
LADY CARMICHAEL, Nothing.
HOLMES, Did your husband describe ...
LADY CARMICHAEL, Nothing – until this morning.
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace?!
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace?
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace!
LADY CARMICHAEL, Ah!
LADY CARMICHAEL, Blast!
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace! Where are you? It’s me!
LADY CARMICHAEL, Who are you? I demand you speak! Who are you?
LADY CARMICHAEL, Eustace! Speak to me!
LADY CARMICHAEL, In the name of God!
SIR EUSTACE, She’s ... she’s Emelia Ricoletti.
BRIDE," This night, Eustace Carmichael, you ... will ... die."
HOLMES," Hush, Watson."
LADY CARMICHAEL, You know the name.
HOLMES, You must forgive Watson. He has an enthusiasm for stating the obvious which borders on mania.
 May I ask, how is your husband this morning?
LADY CARMICHAEL, He refuses to speak about the matter. Obviously I have urged him to leave the house.
HOLMES," No, no! He must stay exactly where he is."
LADY CARMICHAEL," Well, you don’t think he’s in danger?"
HOLMES," Oh no, somebody definitely wants to kill him, but that’s good for us. You can’t set a trap without bait."
LADY CARMICHAEL," My husband is not bait, Mr Holmes."
HOLMES, No. But he could be if we play our cards right.
HOLMES," Now, listen: you must go home immediately. Doctor Watson and I will follow on the next train. There’s not a moment to lose. Sir Eustace is to die tonight."
WATSON, Holmes!
HOLMES, ... and we should ... probably avoid that.
WATSON, Definitely.
HOLMES, Definitely avoid that.
MYCROFT HOLMES," Little brother has taken the case, of course. I now rely on you to keep an eye on things, but he must never suspect you of working for me. Are you clear on that, Watson?"
MRS WATSON," You can rely on me, Mr Holmes."
WATSON, You don’t suppose ...
HOLMES," I don’t, and neither should you."
WATSON, You don’t know what I was going to say.
WATSON," But the Bride! Holmes, Emelia Ricoletti, again. A dead woman, walking the Earth!"
HOLMES," You amaze me, Watson."
WATSON, I do?
HOLMES, Since when have you had any kind of imagination?
WATSON, Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that an unprincipled drug addict is some kind of gentleman hero.
HOLMES," Yes, now you come to mention it, that was quite impressive. (He looks down thoughtfully for a moment, then raises his eyes again.) You may, however, rest assured there are no ghosts in this world."
WATSON, Ghosts we make for ourselves? What do you mean?
SIR EUSTACE, Somnambulism.
WATSON, I beg your pardon?
SIR EUSTACE," I sleepwalk, that’s all. It’s a common enough condition. I thought you were a doctor. The whole thing was a bad dream."
WATSON, Including the contents of the envelope you received?
SIR EUSTACE," Well, that’s a grotesque joke."
WATSON," Well, that’s not the impression you gave your wife, sir."
SIR EUSTACE," She’s an hysteric, prone to fancies."
HOLMES, No.
SIR EUSTACE, I’m sorry? What did you say?
SIR EUSTACE, My wife sees terror in an orange pip.
HOLMES, She married you.
HOLMES, I assume she was capable of finding a reason.
HOLMES," I’ll do my best to save your life tonight, but first it would help if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case."
HOLMES," Yes. In detail, please."
HOLMES, Interesting. I didn’t mention she was a woman. We’ll show ourselves out.
HOLMES, I hope to see you again in the morning.
SIR EUSTACE, You will not!
HOLMES, Then sadly I shall be solving your murder. Good day.
WATSON," Well, you tried."
HOLMES, Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this?
HOLMES, Thank you. Good afternoon.
FOOTMAN," Yes, sir."
WATSON, What was that?
HOLMES," Lady Carmichael will sleep alone tonight, on the pretence of a violent headache. All the doors and windows of the house will be locked."
WATSON," Ah, you think the spectre ..."
WATSON," ... er, the Bride will attempt to lure Sir Eustace outside again?"
WATSON," Well, he won’t follow her, surely?"
HOLMES, It’s difficult to say quite what he’ll do. Guilt is eating away at his soul.
WATSON, Guilt? About what?
HOLMES, Something in his past. The orange pips were a reminder.
HOLMES," Not at all. Orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death, originating in America. Sir Eustace knows this only too well, just as he knows why he is to be punished."
HOLMES," I presume. We all have a past, Watson."
WATSON, Hmm.
HOLMES, Ghosts – they are the shadows that define our every sunny day. Sir Eustace knows he’s a marked man.
HOLMES, There’s something more than murder he fears. He believes he is to be dragged to Hell by the risen corpse of the late Mrs Ricoletti.
WATSON," That’s a lot of nonsense, isn’t it?"
HOLMES," God, yes. Did you bring your revolver?"
WATSON, What good would that be against a ghost?
HOLMES, Exactly. Did you bring it?
WATSON," Yeah, of course."
HOLMES," Then come, Watson, come."
HOLMES, The game is afoot!
s note," At this point, one of my betas made some positively filthy suggestions about what Watson had been doing in that lower position. I’m so proud of her. ;-)  ]"
HOLMES," Get down, Watson, for heaven’s sake!"
WATSON," Is the, er, lamp still burning?"
HOLMES, There goes Sir Eustace.
HOLMES, And Lady Carmichael. The house sleeps.
WATSON," Mmm, good God, this is the longest night of my life."
HOLMES," Have patience, Watson."
WATSON, Only midnight.
WATSON," You know, it’s rare for us to sit together like this."
HOLMES, I should hope so. It’s murder on the knees.
WATSON," Hmm. Two old friends, just talking, chewing the fat ..."
WATSON, ... man to man.
WATSON, She’s a remarkable woman.
HOLMES, Who?
WATSON, Lady Carmichael.
HOLMES," The fair sex is your department, Watson. I’ll take your word for it."
WATSON," No, you liked her. A “woman of rare perception.”"
HOLMES, And admirably high arches. I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.
WATSON, Huh. She’s far too good for him.
HOLMES, You think so?
WATSON," No, you think so. I could tell."
HOLMES," On the contrary, I have no view on the matter."
WATSON, Yes you have.
WATSON," Well, why not?"
HOLMES, What’s the matter with you this evening?
re wearing, there’s a photograph inside it. I glimpsed it once ...
WATSON, I believe it is of Irene Adler.
WATSON," Yes, I did."
HOLMES, You seriously thought I wouldn’t notice?
WATSON, Irene Adler.
HOLMES, Formidable opponent; a remarkable adventure.
WATSON, A very nice photograph.
HOLMES, Why are you talking like this?
WATSON, Why are you so determined to be alone?
HOLMES," Are you quite well, Watson?"
WATSON, Is it such a curious question?
HOLMES," From a Viennese alienist, no; from a retired Army surgeon, most certainly."
WATSON," Holmes, against absolutely no opposition whatsoever, I am your closest friend."
HOLMES, I concede it.
WATSON, I am currently attempting to have a perfectly normal conversation with you.
HOLMES," If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson – which I rather fear you are – as I have often explained before, all emotion is abhorrent to me. It is the grit in a sensitive instrument ..."
WATSON, Yes.
HOLMES," Well, there you are, you see? I’ve said it all before."
WATSON," No, I wrote all that. You’re quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine."
HOLMES," Well, exactly."
WATSON," No, those are my words, not yours! That is the version of you that I present to the public: the brain without a heart; the calculating machine. I write all of that, Holmes, and the readers lap it up, but I do not believe it."
HOLMES," Well, I’ve a good mind to write to your editor."
WATSON," You are a living, breathing man. You’ve lived a life; you have a past."
HOLMES, A what?!
WATSON," Well, you must have had ..."
HOLMES, Had what?
WATSON, You know.
HOLMES, No.
WATSON, Experiences.
WATSON," Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh and blood. You have feelings. You have ... you must have ... impulses."
WATSON, As your friend – as someone who ... worries about you – what made you like this?
HOLMES," Oh, Watson. Nothing made me."
HOLMES, I made me.
HOLMES, Redbeard?
WATSON, Good God!
WATSON, What are we to do?
HOLMES," Pleasant night for the time of year, is it not?"
WATSON," It cannot be true, Holmes. It cannot!"
HOLMES," No, it can’t."
WATSON, Is it locked?
WATSON," That was a window breaking, wasn’t it?"
HOLMES, There’s only one broken window we need concern ourselves with.
HOLMES," Stay in here, Watson."
WATSON, What? No!
HOLMES, All the doors and windows to the house are locked. This is their only way out. I need you here.
WATSON," But the sound was so close, it had to be from this side of the house."
HOLMES, Stay here!
LADY CARMICHAEL, You promised to keep him safe. You promised!
LADY CARMICHAEL, You ...
LADY CARMICHAEL, You promised!
WATSON," You’re human, I know that. You must be."
WATSON," Little use, us standing here in the dark."
WATSON," After all, this is the nineteenth century."
HOLMES, Watson!
HOLMES, Don’t tell me you abandoned your post.
WATSON," What? Holmes, she’s there! (He points with his revolver.) I saw her!"
HOLMES," Empty, thanks to you! Our bird is flown."
WATSON," No! No, Holmes, it wasn’t what you think. I saw her – the ghost."
WATSON, What happened? Where is Sir Eustace? 
HOLMES, Dead.
LESTRADE," You really mustn’t blame yourself, you know."
HOLMES," No, you’re quite right."
WATSON, I’m glad you’re seeing sense.
HOLMES," Watson is equally culpable. Between us, we’ve managed to botch this whole case. I gave an undertaking to protect that man; now he’s lying there with a dagger in his breast."
LESTRADE," Anything you can tell us, Doctor?"
WATSON," Well, he’s been stabbed with considerable force."
LESTRADE," It’s a man, then."
WATSON, Possibly.
LESTRADE," A very keen blade, so it could conceivably have been a woman."
HOLMES, Watson.
WATSON, You said yourself: I have no imagination.
HOLMES," Then use your brain, such as it is, to eliminate the impossible – which in this case is the ghost – and observe what remains – which in this case is a solution so blindingly obvious, even Lestrade could work it out."
LESTRADE, Thank you(!)
LESTRADE, They did leave a note.
LESTRADE, What other broken window?
HOLMES," Precisely. There isn’t one. The only broken window in this establishment is the one that Watson and I entered through, yet prior to that we distinctly heard the sound of What did you just say?"
LESTRADE, Sorry?
HOLMES, About a note. What did you just say?
LESTRADE, I said the murderer did leave a note.
HOLMES, No they didn’t.
LESTRADE, There’s a message tied to the dagger. You must have seen it!
LESTRADE, Yes!
HOLMES, There was no message when I found the body.
WATSON, Holmes?
WATSON, What is it?
MYCROFT HOLMES, Do you?
HOLMES, Do I what?
HOLMES, Moriarty is dead.
MYCROFT HOLMES, And yet.
HOLMES, His body was never recovered.
MYCROFT HOLMES, To be expected when one pushes a maths professor over a waterfall. Pure reason toppled by sheer melodrama: your life in a nutshell.
HOLMES, Have you put on weight?
MYCROFT HOLMES, You saw me only yesterday. Does that seem possible?
MYCROFT HOLMES," You’re in deep, Sherlock, deeper than you ever intended to be. Have you made a list?"
HOLMES, Of what?
MYCROFT HOLMES, Everything. We will need a list.
MYCROFT HOLMES, Good boy.
HOLMES, No. I haven’t finished yet.
MYCROFT HOLMES, Moriarty may beg to differ.
HOLMES," He’s trying to distract me, to derail me."
MYCROFT HOLMES," Yes. He’s the crack in the lens, the fly in the ointment ... the virus in the data."
HOLMES, I have to finish this.
MYCROFT HOLMES," If Moriarty has risen from the Reichenbach cauldron, he will seek you out."
HOLMES, I’ll be waiting.

MRS HUDSON, Two days he’s been like that.
LESTRADE, Has he eaten?
LESTRADE, Press are having a ruddy field day. There’s still reporters outside.
MRS HUDSON, They’ve been there all the time. I can’t get rid of them. I’ve been rushed off my feet making tea.
LESTRADE, Why d’you make ’em tea? 
MRS HUDSON, I don’t know. I just sort of do.
LESTRADE," He said there’s only one suspect and then he just walks away, and now he won’t explain."
MRS HUDSON," Which is strange, because he likes that bit."
LESTRADE," Said it was so simple, I could solve it."
MRS HUDSON, I’m sure he was exaggerating.
LESTRADE," What’s he doing, do you think?"
MRS HUDSON, He says he’s waiting.
LESTRADE, For what?
MRS HUDSON, The devil.
MRS HUDSON, I wouldn’t be surprised. We get all sorts here.
LESTRADE," Well, wire me if there’s any change."
MRS HUDSON, Yeah.
MORIARTY, Like a bullet.
MORIARTY," It’s a dangerous habit, to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one’s dressing gown. Or are you just pleased to see me?"
HOLMES, You’ll forgive me for taking precautions.
MORIARTY, I’d be offended if you didn’t.
MORIARTY, Obviously I’ve returned the courtesy.
MORIARTY, I like your rooms. They smell so ... 
MORIARTY, ... manly.
HOLMES, I’m sure you’ve acquainted yourself with them before now.
MORIARTY," Well, you are always away on your little adventures for The Strand. Tell me: does the illustrator travel with you? Do you have to pose ..."
MORIARTY, ... during your deductions?
MORIARTY, I know you are.
HOLMES, Yes.
MORIARTY," Doesn’t taste the same, though. You want your skin fresh ... (he waves the licked hand in the air as if trying to describe the flavour of his favourite recipe) ... just a little crispy."
MORIARTY," That’s all people really are, you know: dust waiting to be distributed. And it gets everywhere ... (he sticks out his tongue and waggles it as if trying to shake off the dust he just licked) ... in every breath you take, dancing in every sunbeam, all used-up people."
HOLMES, Won’t you sit ...
MORIARTY," D’you mind if I fire this, just to clean it out?"
MORIARTY, Exactly. Let’s stop playing. We don’t need toys to kill each other. Where’s the intimacy in that?
HOLMES, Sit down.
MORIARTY, Why? What do you want?
MORIARTY, Not true. You know that’s not true.
MORIARTY," What do you want, Sherlock?"
HOLMES, The truth.
MORIARTY, That.
MORIARTY, Truth’s boring.
MORIARTY," You didn’t expect me to turn up at the scene of the crime, did you? Poor old Sir Eustace. He got what was coming to him."
HOLMES, But you couldn’t have killed him.
MORIARTY," But she did it, and you need to know how. How ...?"
MORIARTY, ... don’t you? It’s tearing your world apart not knowing.
HOLMES," ... to distract me, derail me."
MORIARTY, Because doesn’t this remind you of another case?
MORIARTY, Hasn’t this all happened before? There’s nothing new under the sun.
MORIARTY, What was it? What was it? What was that case? Huh? D’you remember?
MORIARTY, Ed ith the noo thethy.
MORIARTY, Dead ...
MORIARTY," Well, I’ll tell you what: that rather blows the cobwebs away."
MORIARTY," How do I look, huh?"
MORIARTY, Huh?
HOLMES, I saw you die. (He narrows his eyes.) Why aren’t you dead?
DIAMOND," We’ve landed, sir. We’ve landed."
CAPTAIN," I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir."
MYCROFT," Well, a somewhat shorter exile than we’d imagined, brother mine, although adequate given your levels of OCD."
SHERLOCK, I have to go back!
MYCROFT, What?
SHERLOCK, I was ... I was nearly there! I nearly had it!
MYCROFT, What on earth are you talking about?
JOHN, Go back where? You didn’t get very far.
SHERLOCK, Ricoletti and his abominable wife! Don’t you understand?
MARY," No, of course we don’t. You’re not making any sense, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK," It was a case, a famous one from a hundred years ago, lodged in my hard drive. She seemed to be dead but then she came back."
JOHN," What, like Moriarty?"
SHERLOCK," Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty."
SHERLOCK," I’ve been in my Mind Palace, of course ..."
JOHN, Of course(!)
SHERLOCK, ... running an experiment: how would I have solved the crime if I’d been there in 1895?
MYCROFT," Oh, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK, I had all the details perfect.
JOHN," No, he can do this. I’ve seen it – the Mind Palace. It’s like a whole world in his head."
MYCROFT, The Mind Palace is a memory technique. I know what it can do; and I know what it most certainly cannot.
SHERLOCK, Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don’t.
SHERLOCK, You’ve put on weight. That waistcoat’s clearly newer than the jacket ...
SHERLOCK, Of what?
MYCROFT," Everything, Sherlock. Everything you’ve taken."
JOHN," No, it’s not that. He goes into a sort of trance. I’ve seen him do it."
MYCROFT, ... there will always be a list.
JOHN, He couldn’t have taken all of that in the last five minutes.
MYCROFT, He was high before he got on the plane.
SHERLOCK, I’m not an addict. I’m a user. I alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes.
JOHN, For God’s sake! This could kill you! You could die!
SHERLOCK," Controlled usage is not usually fatal, and abstinence is not immortality."
MYCROFT, What are you doing?
MARY, Emelia Ricoletti – I’m looking her up.
MYCROFT," Ah, I suppose we should."
MYCROFT, I have access to the top level of the MI5 archive ...
MARY," Yep, that’s where I’m looking."
MYCROFT, What do you think of MI5’s security?
MARY, Emelia Ricoletti. Unsolved ...
MARY, ... like he says.
JOHN, ‘Yapping’? (Sarcastically) Sorry – did we interrupt your session?
MYCROFT, I’m not angry with you ...
SHERLOCK," Oh, that’s a relief. I was really worried. (He opens his eyes.) No, hold on. (He looks at Mycroft.) I really wasn’t."
SHERLOCK, Realised what?
MYCROFT," That in your case, solitary confinement is locking you up with your worst enemy."
SHERLOCK," Oh, for God’s sake."
SHERLOCK, What did you say?
JOHN, I didn’t say anything.
SHERLOCK," No, you did. You said ..."
JOHN, Which is it today – morphine or cocaine?
WATSON, Holmes?
HOLMES, Moriarty was here.
WATSON, Moriarty’s dead.
HOLMES, I was on a jet.
WATSON, A what?
WATSON," You haven’t left these rooms, Holmes. You ... haven’t ... moved. Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine?"
HOLMES, A seven percent solution.
HOLMES, Would you care to try it?
WATSON, Then you would be reminded ... quite forcibly ... which of us is a soldier and which of us a drug addict.
HOLMES, You’re not a soldier. You are a doctor.
HOLMES," My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgement."
HOLMES," No, I just said that in one of your stories. (He smiles.)"
WATSON," Listen. (He points at Holmes, breathing rapidly.) I’m happy to play the fool for you. I will run along behind you like some halfwit, making you look clever, if that’s what you need, but dear God above ... (his voice rises angrily) ... you will hold yourself to a higher standard."
HOLMES, Why?
WATSON, Because people need you to.
HOLMES, What people? Why? Because of your idiot stories?
WATSON," Yes, because of my idiot stories."
BILLY," Mr Holmes! Telegram, Mr Holmes!"
WATSON, What is it? What’s wrong?
HOLMES, It’s Mary.
WATSON, Mary? What about her?
HOLMES, It’s entirely possible she’s in danger.
WATSON, Danger?
HOLMES, There’s not a moment to lose.
WATSON, Is this the cocaine talking?
WATSON, What danger could Mary be in? I’m sure she’s just visiting with friends.
WATSON, What is happening?
WATSON, Are you even in a fit state?
HOLMES," For Mary, of course. Never doubt that, Watson. Never that."
WATSON, Holmes!
WATSON, This one.
HOLMES, Why?
WATSON, You’re Sherlock Holmes. Wear the damn hat.
WATSON, Cab? Cab!
WATSON," So, tell me. Where is she?"
WATSON, You must tell me. What’s going on?
WATSON, Holmes! Where is she?
HOLMES," A desanctified church. She thinks she’s found the solution, and for no better reason than that, she’s put herself in the path of considerable danger."
HOLMES, What an excellent choice of wife.
WATSON, What the devil?!
MRS WATSON," This is the heart of it all, John, the heart of the conspiracy."
MRS WATSON, I’ve been making enquiries. Mr Holmes asked me.
WATSON," Holmes, how could you?!"
MRS WATSON," No, not him. The clever one."
MRS WATSON, It seemed obvious to me that this business could not be managed alone. My theory is that Mrs Ricoletti had help – help from her friends.
HOLMES," Bravo, Mary. (He looks at her, finally catching up with what she just said.) ‘The clever one’?"
MRS WATSON, Oh.
WATSON, I thought perhaps we were neglecting each other.
HOLMES," Well, you’re the one who moved out."
WATSON, You’re working for Mycroft?
MRS WATSON, He likes to keep an eye on his mad sibling.
HOLMES, And he had a spy to hand. (Glancing towards Watson) Has it never occurred to you that your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse?
MRS WATSON, Of course it hasn’t. (She smirks.) Because he knows what a nurse is capable of.
HOLMES," Only now, I’m afraid."
HOLMES, Time I sped up. Enough chatter. Let’s concentrate.
MRS WATSON," Yes, all right. What’s all this about? What do they want to accomplish?"
HOLMES, Why don’t we go and find out?
MRS WATSON, Never have guessed(!)
HOLMES, Excellent.
HOLMES, Superlative theatre. I applaud the spectacle.
HOLMES," Emelia Ricoletti shot herself, then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband. So, how was it done? Let’s take the events in order."
BRIDE, You?! (Softly) Or me?
RICOLETTI, Who are you? What do you want?
RICOLETTI, Emelia?!
EMELIA, Swiftly now. No tears.
MRS WATSON, But why would she do that – die to prove a point?
HOLMES," Every great cause has martyrs; every war has suicide missions – and make no mistake, this is war. One half of the human race at war with the other."
HOLMES," The invisible army hovering at our elbow, attending to our homes, raising our children, ignored, patronised, disregarded, not allowed so much as a vote."
HOLMES," ... but an army nonetheless, ready to rise up in the best of causes, to put right an injustice as old as humanity itself. So, you see, Watson, Mycroft was right. This is a war we must lose."
WATSON, She was dying.
HOLMES, Who was?
WATSON, Emelia Ricoletti. There were clear signs of consumption. I doubt she was long for this world.
HOLMES, So she decided to make her death count. She was already familiar with the secret societies of America and was able to draw on their methods of fear and intimidation to publicly – very publicly – confront Sir Eustace Carmichael with the sins of his past.
HOOPER," ... marriage, position – and then he had his way with her and threw her over, left her abandoned and penniless."
HOLMES, Hooper!
WATSON," For the record, Holmes, she didn’t have me fooled."
JANE," Why do you never mention me, sir?"
JANINE," Emelia thought that she’d found happiness with Ricoletti, but he was a brute too."
s note," in the cast list for this episode, she is credited as ‘Janine Donlevy.’ People with sharp eyes noticed that in “His Last Vow” her newspaper interviews about her relationship with Sherlock named her as ‘Janine Hawkins.’ It may be that this Victorian version is – or was – married.]"
WATSON," But ... the Bride, Holmes. We saw her."
HOLMES, Just an old theatrical trick.
WATSON," It cannot be true, Holmes! It cannot!"
HOLMES," No, it can’t."
HOLMES, The avenging ghost – a legend to strike terror into the heart of any man with malicious intent; a spectre to stalk those unpunished brutes whose reckoning is long overdue.
HOLMES," This is the work of a single-minded person, someone who knew first-hand about Sir Eustace’s mental cruelty. A dark secret, kept from all but her closest friends ..."
HOLMES, ... including Emelia Ricoletti ...
HOLMES," ... the woman her husband wronged all those years before. If one disregards the ghost, there is only one suspect."
HOLMES," Isn’t that right, Lady Carmichael?"
HOLMES," One small detail doesn’t quite make sense to me, however. Why engage me to prevent a murder you intended to commit?"
HOLMES, Hmm?
s VOICE, It’s not real.
s VOICE," Oh, Sherlock."
MORIARTY, Peekaboo.
HOLMES," No. No, not you. It can’t be you."
MORIARTY," I mean, come on, be serious. Costumes, the gong. Speaking as a criminal mastermind, we don’t really have gongs, or special outfits."
WATSON, What the hell is going on?
MORIARTY," Is this silly enough for you yet? Gothic enough? Mad enough, even for you? It doesn’t make sense, Sherlock, because it’s not real. (In a whisper) None of it."
WATSON, What’s he talking about?
s VOICE, Sherlock.
s VOICE, Holmes!
MARY, Is he dreaming?
 May I just check, is this what you mean by “controlled usage”?
MYCROFT," What, a hundred and twenty years ago?!"
MYCROFT," That would take weeks to find, if those records even exist. Even with my resources ..."
JOHN, I don’t get it. How is this relevant?
SHERLOCK," I need to know I was right, then I’ll be sure."
MARY, You mean how Moriarty did it?
SHERLOCK, Yes.
JOHN, But none of that really happened. It was in your head.
SHERLOCK, My investigation was the fantasy. The crime happened exactly as I explained.
MARY, The stone was erected by a group of her friends.
MYCROFT, I don’t know what you think you’ll find here.
SHERLOCK, I need to try!
SHERLOCK," Mrs Ricoletti was buried here, but what happened to the other one, the corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide?"
JOHN, They’d move it. Of course they would.
SHERLOCK, But where?
JOHN," Well, not here!"
SHERLOCK," But that ... that’s exactly what they must have done. The conspirators had someone on the inside. They found a body, just like Molly Hooper found a body for me when I ..."
JOHN, You’re not seriously gonna do this?
SHERLOCK, It’s why we came here! I need to know.
SHERLOCK, John ...
JOHN, Moriarty’s back. We have a case! We have a real-life problem right now.
SHERLOCK, Getting to that! It’s next on the list! Just let me do this.
JOHN," When you’re ready to go to work, give me a call."
JOHN, I’m taking Mary home.
JOHN, Mary’s taking me home.
MARY, Better.
MYCROFT," He’s right, you know."
MYCROFT, Cherchez la femme.
SHERLOCK, Urgh!
MYCROFT, Oh dear. The cupboard is bare.
SHERLOCK, They must have buried it underneath. They must have buried it underneath the coffin.
LESTRADE," Bad luck, Sherlock."
LESTRADE, Maybe they got rid of the body in another way.
MYCROFT," More than likely. At any rate, it was a very long time ago. We do have slightly more pressing matters to hand, little brother. Moriarty, back from the dead?"
MORIARTY," Too deep, Sherlock. Way too deep."
MORIARTY, Congratulations. You’ll be the first man in history to be buried in his own Mind Palace.
MORIARTY, For you and me? (He looks up at the spray splashing over him.) Not at all.
HOLMES, What are you?
MORIARTY, You know what I am. I’m Moriarty. (In a slightly sarcastic voice) The Napoleon of crime.
MORIARTY," Not in your mind. (He shakes his head.) I’ll never be dead there. You once called your brain a hard drive. (He starts to walk forward.) Well, say hello to the virus. This is how we end, you and I. Always here, always together."
HOLMES," You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it."
HOLMES, I concede it may be even be the equal of my own.
MORIARTY, I’m touched. I’m honoured.
HOLMES, But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat on the edge of a precipice ...
HOLMES, ... you’re going in the water ...
HOLMES, ... short-arse.
MORIARTY," Every time you STUMBLE, every time you FAIL, when you’re WEAK ..."
MORIARTY, I ... AM ... (he bends and punches his chest again) ... THERE!
MORIARTY, No. Don’t try to fight it. LIE BACK AND LOSE!
WATSON," Professor, if you wouldn’t mind stepping away from my friend. I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying."
MORIARTY, That’s not fair. There’s two of you!
WATSON, There’s always two of us. Don’t you read The Strand?
WATSON," On your knees, Professor."
WATSON, Hands behind your head.
HOLMES," Thank you, John."
WATSON, Since when do you call me John?
HOLMES, You’d be surprised. (He smiles.)
WATSON," No I wouldn’t. (He smiles back briefly, then looks down towards Moriarty.) Time you woke up, Sherlock."
WATSON, I’m a storyteller. I know when I’m in one.
HOLMES," Of course. Of course you do, John. (He smiles again.)"
WATSON," So what’s he like? The other me, in the other place?"
HOLMES, Smarter than he looks.
WATSON," Pretty damned smart, then."
MORIARTY," Urgh. Why don’t you two just elope, for God’s sake?"
WATSON, Impertinent!
HOLMES, Offensive.
WATSON, Actually ... (he lowers his revolver) ... would you mind?
HOLMES, Not at all.
WATSON, It was my turn.
HOLMES, Quite so.
WATSON," So, how do you plan to wake up?"
WATSON, Are you sure?
HOLMES," Between you and me, John, I always survive a fall."
WATSON, But how?
SHERLOCK, Miss me?
JOHN, Sherlock? You all right?
SHERLOCK," Yes, of course I am. Why wouldn’t I be?"
MARY, ’Cause you probably just OD’d. You should be in hospital.
SHERLOCK, No time. (He starts to get up.) I have to go to Baker Street now. Moriarty’s back.
MYCROFT," I almost hope he is, if it’ll save you from this. "
SHERLOCK, No need for that now. (He drops the pieces to the floor.) Got the real thing. I have work to do.
SHERLOCK," What are you still doing here? Shouldn’t you be off getting me a pardon or something, like a proper big brother?"
MYCROFT, Doctor Watson?
MYCROFT, Look after him ...
MYCROFT, ... please?
JOHN," Sherlock, hang on. Explain. Moriarty’s alive, then?"
MARY, So he’s dead.
SHERLOCK, Of course he’s dead. He blew his own brains out. No-one survives that. I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it.
SHERLOCK," Moriarty is dead, no question. But more importantly ..."
SHERLOCK, ... I know exactly what he’s going to do next.
WATSON, What sort of lunatic fantasy is that?
HOLMES," It was simply my conjecture of what a future world might look like, and how you and I might fit inside it."
HOLMES," From a drop of water, a logician should be able to infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara."
WATSON, Or a Reichenbach.
HOLMES, Have you written up your account of the case?
WATSON, Yes.
HOLMES," Hmm. Modified to put it down as one of my rare failures, of course?"
WATSON, Of course.
HOLMES, “The Adventure of ... the Invisible Army.”
HOLMES," “The League of Furies”? (He leans forward, smiling.) “The Monstrous Regiment.”"
WATSON, I rather thought ... “The Abominable Bride.”
WATSON," It’ll sell. It’s got proper murders in it, too."
WATSON," As for your own tale, are you sure it’s still just a seven percent solution that you take? I think you may have increased the dosage."
HOLMES, Perhaps I was being a little fanciful ...
HOLMES, ... but perhaps such things could come to pass.
HOLMES," In any case, I know I would be very much at home in such a world."
WATSON, Don’t think I would be.
HOLMES, I beg to differ.
HOLMES, But then I’ve always known I was a man out of his time.
          CASE, BT198255D./SH
MYCROFT, Is that quite clear? (He looks towards the elderly lady.) Don’t minute any of this.
MYCROFT," Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it. A D-notice has been slapped on the entire incident. Only those within this room – code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love – will ever know the whole truth."
MYCROFT," As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus ... Are you tweeting?!"
SHERLOCK, No.
MYCROFT," Well, that’s what it looks like."
SHERLOCK, Of course I’m not tweeting. Why would I be tweeting?
MYCROFT, Give me that.
SHERLOCK, What? No. Get off. What are you doing?
SHERLOCK, Get off. What ...?
MYCROFT, “Back on terra firma.”
SHERLOCK, Don’t read them out.
MYCROFT, “Free as a bird.”
SHERLOCK," God, you’re such a spoilsport."
SHERLOCK, I am taking it seriously. What makes you think I’m not taking it seriously?
SHERLOCK, Love ginger nuts.
LADY SMALLWOOD, Our doctor said you were clean.
SHERLOCK," I am, utterly. (He turns and looks at Mycroft as he walks back towards his chair.) No need for stimulants now, remember? I have work to do."
SIR EDWIN, You’re high as a kite!
SHERLOCK, What shall we do next? (He points at the elderly woman.) What’s your name?
SHERLOCK," What would you do, Vivian?"
VIVIAN, Pardon?
SHERLOCK," Well, it’s a lovely day. Go for a stroll?"
SHERLOCK, Make a paper aeroplane? Have an ice lolly? (He takes another bite of a biscuit.)
VIVIAN," Ice lolly, I suppose."
VIVIAN, Do they still do Mivvis?
s note," They do, Vivian. See here.]"
LADY SMALLWOOD, We do need to get on.
SHERLOCK," I see. Who is supposed to have shot him, then?"
SIR EDWIN," Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger, that’s who."
SHERLOCK, That’s not what happened at all. (He takes another bite of biscuit.)
MYCROFT, It is now.
LADY SMALLWOOD, Remarkable. How did you do it?
SIR EDWIN," We have some very talented people working here. If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to, er ... doctor a bit of security footage. "
SIR EDWIN, That is now the official version; the version anyone we want to will see.
LADY SMALLWOOD," No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon. You’re off the hook, Mr Holmes. You’re home and dry."
SHERLOCK," Okay, cheers."
LADY SMALLWOOD, Obviously there’s unfinished business. Moriarty.
LADY SMALLWOOD, You say he filmed that video message before he died.
LADY SMALLWOOD, You also say you know what he’s going to do next. What does that mean?
SIR EDWIN, Perhaps that’s all there is to it. (He points towards Sherlock.) Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
SHERLOCK," No, no. He would never be that disappointing. (He gazes into the distance.) He’s planned something; something long-term; something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive. Posthumous revenge. No – better than that. Posthumous game."
LADY SMALLWOOD, We brought you back to deal with this. What are you going to do?
SHERLOCK, Wait.
LADY SMALLWOOD, “Wait”?!
SHERLOCK," Of course wait. I’m the target. Targets wait. Look – whatever’s coming, whatever he’s lined up, I’ll know when it begins."
SHERLOCK, I always know when the game is on. D’you know why?
But tell me," why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?” “Because,” said Death, “I had an appointment with you tonight – in Samarra.”"
SHERLOCK," If this gets any better, I’m gonna get two knives."
JOHN, It pays to advertise.
MARY," So, what about Moriarty, then?"
SHERLOCK," Ooh, I have a plan."
SHERLOCK, I’m going to monitor the underworld – every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
JOHN, Basically your ‘plan’ is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do.
FEMALE CLIENT," He drowned, Mr Holmes."
FEMALE CLIENT, That’s what we thought but when they opened up his lungs ...
MARY, Yes?
FEMALE CLIENT, Sand.
SHERLOCK, Come back! It’s the wrong thumb!
MARY, Sherlock ...
DIMMOCK, Bloody hell! Is that a guess?
SHERLOCK, I never guess.
MARY, Sherlock ...
HOPKINS, So he’s the killer? The canary trainer?
SHERLOCK, ’Course he’s the killer.
HOPKINS, Didn’t see that coming.
SHERLOCK," Hm, naturally."
JOHN," Sherlock, you can’t go on spinning plates like this."
SHERLOCK, That’s it! The place was spinning.
SHERLOCK, The heart medication you are taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Mr FENTIMAN," Yes, um ... I think so. Why?"
JOHN, A jellyfish?!
SHERLOCK, I know.
JOHN, You can’t arrest a jellyfish!
JOHN, We did try.
JOHN, Oh God.
JOHN, Fifty-nine missed calls.
SHERLOCK, We’re in a lot of trouble.
MARY, Ow! Oh my God. Oh my God!
JOHN, Relax. It’s got two syllables ...
MARY," I’m a nurse, darling. I think I know what to do."
JOHN," Come on then, come on."
MARY, Re...
JOHN, ...lax. (He blows out the breath.)
SHERLOCK," That’s it, Mary. Re... (He purses his lips and sucks in a breath.)"
MARY," John? (She braces her other hand against Sherlock’s head.) John, I think you have to pull over."
JOHN," Mary, Mary ..."
MARY, Pull Over!
SHERLOCK, Oh my God.
MRS HUDSON, Has that come out?
MRS HUDSON, They never come out when I take them!
MRS HUDSON, Aww. She’s so beautiful.
MOLLY, Have another go.
JOHN, Catherine.
MARY," Uh, yeah, we’ve gone off that."
JOHN, Have we?
MARY, Yeah.
JOHN, Oh.
JOHN," Molly, Mrs H. We would love you to be godparents."
JOHN, If you ...
MOLLY, Really?
MRS HUDSON, So lovely!
JOHN," And, uh ..."
JOHN," ... you, too, Sherlock?"
JOHN, Godfather? We’d like you to be godfather.
SHERLOCK, God is a ludicrous fiction dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
JOHN," Yeah, but there’ll be cake. Will you do it?"
SHERLOCK, I’ll get back to you.
VICAR," Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water ... (he leans forward and draws the sign of the cross in the water) ... and sanctify it for our use this day, in Christ’s name."
VICAR," Now, what name have you given your daughter? "
MARY, Rosamund Mary.
SHERLOCK," Rosamund? (Frowning, he looks up briefly.)"
MOLLY, Didn’t you get John’s text?
SHERLOCK," No. I delete his texts. I delete any text that begins, ‘Hi.’"
MOLLY, No idea why people think you’re incapable of human emotion.
VICAR," And now, godparents ..."
SIRI," Sorry, I didn’t catch that. "
SHERLOCK," As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe."
SHERLOCK," To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery whereas, to me, it is an open book. Hard logic versus romantic whimsy. That is your choice. You fail to connect actions to their consequences. Now, for the last time ... (he bends down and picks up a jingling baby’s rattle) ... if you want to keep the rattle ..."
SHERLOCK," ... do not throw the rattle, hm?"
s note," some of my beta team queried why I said this scene takes place ‘a few months later.’ To fend off further enquiries, I simply say that the fact that Rosie is now old enough to sit up and throw things suggested to me that she’s more than a few weeks old.]"
JOHN," I’d better finish this, hadn’t I?"
LESTRADE, Hey.
JOHN," Afternoon. He says you’ve got a good one, Greg."
LESTRADE, Oh yeah.
DAVID," God, fifty! Where did it go?! I know for a fact I was only twenty-one this time last week!"
EMMA," Yeah, well that’s impossible, ’cause that’s before you met me and ..."
DAVID," Well, no ..."
EMMA, She’s looking at me disapprovingly again.
DAVID," No, she’s just jealous."
EMMA," Yeah, well, I think we both are."
DAVID, Ooh.
EMMA," No, no, David. Come on, you promised."
DAVID," Oh, it’s a Skype call."
EMMA," Oh, then, that’s ... must be Charlie. At least he’s phoning, I suppose."
DAVID," Oh, look! Hello!"
CHARLIE," Hey, Dad!"
CHARLIE," Happy birthday! Sorry to miss your party but, uh ... (he tilts his head towards the background) ... travel broadens the mind, right?"
DAVID, Why-why is it rubbish? Where are you?
EMMA, How is he? Is he eating? Ask him if he’s eating.
DAVID," No, shh."
DAVID," So, Charlie, where are you? ... Are you there?"
DAVID, You all right? 
DAVID, Altitude?
DAVID," Look, never mind mountains. Your mother wants to know if you’re eating properly. (He laughs.)"
DAVID, What?
DAVID," Er, yes, I can do that."
DAVID, All done. You got it? ... Charlie?
LESTRADE, A week later ...
LESTRADE, ... something really weird happens.
LESTRADE," Drunk driver – he’s totally smashed, the cops are chasing him ..."
LESTRADE, ... and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away. Unfortunately ...
JOHN, Whose body?
JOHN, What?
LESTRADE," The son who was in Tibet. DNA all checks out. The night of the party, the car’s empty, then a week later the dead boy’s found at the wheel."
LESTRADE," Yeah, I thought it’d tickle you."
JOHN, Have you got a lab report?
LESTRADE," Yeah, Charlie Welsborough’s the son of a Cabinet minister ..."
LESTRADE, ... so I’m under a lot of pressure to get results.
SHERLOCK, Who cares about that? Tell me about the seats.
JOHN, The seats?
SHERLOCK, Yes. The car seats.
SHERLOCK, Made of vinyl ... two different types of vinyl present.
SHERLOCK, Was it his own car?
LESTRADE, Yeah. Not flash – he was a student.
LESTRADE, Why?
SHERLOCK, Vinyl’s cheaper than leather.
JOHN, There’s something else.
SHERLOCK, Yes?
JOHN, The body in the car – dead for a week.
SHERLOCK," Oh, this is a good one. (He looks at Greg.) Is it my birthday? You want help?"
SHERLOCK, One condition.
LESTRADE, Okay.
SHERLOCK, Take all the credit.
SHERLOCK, It gets boring if I just solve them all.
LESTRADE," Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it and you get all the credit anyway."
JOHN," Yeah, he’s got a point."
LESTRADE, Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn’t do.
JOHN," Oh, I think you’ve hit a sore spot, Sherlock."
LESTRADE, ... like I’m some kind of credit junkie.
JOHN, Definitely a sore spot.
LESTRADE," ... thanks all the same. (He looks frustrated.) Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you? It’s driving me nuts."
SHERLOCK," Anything you say, Giles."
SHERLOCK, Just kidding.
JOHN," It’s obvious, though, isn’t it, what happened?"
SHERLOCK," John, you amaze me. You know what happened?"
JOHN, Not a clue. It’s just you normally say that at this point.
SHERLOCK," ... let’s help you solve your little problem, Greg."
LESTRADE, You hear that?
JOHN, I know!
JOHN," Oh, good, great! Yeah, amazing."
LESTRADE, Getting any sleep?
JOHN," Christ, no."
LESTRADE," You’re at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey his every whim. (He looks pointedly at Sherlock.) Must feel very different."
SHERLOCK," I’m sorry, what?"
JOHN," Yes, well, you know how it is. All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head."
SHERLOCK, Are you two having a little joke?
JOHN, Never a word of thanks. Can’t even tell people’s faces apart.
SHERLOCK," This is a joke, isn’t it?"
LESTRADE," Then it’s all, ‘Ooh, aren’t you clever? You’re so, so clever!’"
SHERLOCK, Is it about me?
s note," in this context, ‘winding’ means that he needs burping, like a fretful baby who has wind or colic.]"
JOHN," You know, I think that really might be it."
SHERLOCK," No, don’t get it."
 as suggested by SwissMarg," When Sherlock says this line, he’s reflected in the hall mirror and so obviously his image is reversed, which has caused much online confusion as to why his parting briefly appeared to be on the wrong side of his head.]"
LESTRADE," Charlie’s family are pretty cut up about it, as you’d expect, so go easy on them, yeah?"
SHERLOCK, You know me.
JOHN, Yeah.
MARY, And what does he think? Any theories?
JOHN," Uh, well, I texted you the details."
MARY," Yeah, two different types of vinyl."
JOHN, Hey!
MARY," Oh, you’d be amazed at what a receptionist picks up. (She leans closer to the phone and whispers loudly and dramatically.) They know everything!"
SHERLOCK," Solved it, then?"
SHERLOCK," Oh, Mary, motherhood’s slowing you down."
MARY, Pig!
SHERLOCK, Keep trying.
MARY," So, what about it, then?"
MARY," What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it? And what are you gonna call this one?"
JOHN," Ooh, the ... uh, The Ghost Driver."
JOHN, People like the titles.
SHERLOCK, I hate the titles.
JOHN, Give the people what they want.
SHERLOCK," No, never do that. People are stupid."
MARY," Uh, some people."
SHERLOCK, All people are stupid. ... Most people.
LESTRADE," Bizarre enough, though, isn’t it, to be him? (He looks at Sherlock.) I mean, it’s right up your strasse."
SHERLOCK, Mr and Mrs Welsborough. (He takes Emma’s hand to shake it.) I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
LESTRADE," Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes."
DAVID," Thank you very much for coming. We’ve heard a great deal about you. If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you."
SHERLOCK," Well, I believe that I ..."
DAVID," But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes. I ..."
JOHN, Sherlock?
DAVID, Mr Holmes?
SHERLOCK, Sorry. You were saying?
DAVID," Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes. I ... I don’t think we’ll ever get over this."
SHERLOCK," No, shouldn’t think so."
SHERLOCK, So sorry. Will you excuse me a moment? I just ...
JOHN," I’ll just, um ..."
JOHN, Now what’s wrong?
SHERLOCK, Not sure. I just ... ‘By the pricking of my thumbs.’
SHERLOCK," Intuitions are not to be ignored, John. They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend."
SHERLOCK, What is this?
DAVID," Oh, it’s a sort of shrine, I suppose, really."
DAVID, Bit of a fan of Mrs T. Big hero of mine when I was getting started.
SHERLOCK, Who?
DAVID, What?
SHERLOCK, Who-who is this? (He gestures to the table.)
DAVID, Are you serious? 
DAVID," It’s ... it’s Margaret Thatcher, the first female prime minister of this country."
SHERLOCK, Right.
SHERLOCK, Prime minister?
SHERLOCK, Right.
JOHN, For God’s sake. You know perfectly well who she is.
JOHN, Why are you playing for time?
SHERLOCK," It’s the gap. (He focuses on the space between the items on the table.) Look at the gap. It’s wrong. Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed ..."
SHERLOCK, This whole thing’s verging on OCD.
SHERLOCK," My respects. This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner’s been in. (He points to the official picture.) This picture’s straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains. (He points to the vacant spot in the middle of the table.) Something’s missing from here, but only recently. (He squats down again to focus on the scratched leather.)"
DAVID," Yes, a ... "
SHERLOCK, ... plaster bust.
EMMA, What?
SHERLOCK," Well, how could it get broken? The only place for it to fall is the floor, and there is a big thick rug."
EMMA, Does it matter?
JOHN," Mrs Welsborough, my apologies. It is worth letting him do this."
EMMA, Is your friend quite mad?
JOHN," No, he’s an arsehole, but it’s an easy mistake."
DAVID," Look, no, we had a break-in. Some little bastard smashed it to bits. We found the remains out there in the porch."
SHERLOCK, The porch where we came in?
DAVID," How anybody could hate her so much, they’d go to the trouble of smashing her likeness ..."
SHERLOCK," I’m no expert but, er, possibly her face?"
SHERLOCK," Why didn’t he smash all the others? Perfect opportunity, and look at that one. (He points to the official photo.) She’s smiling in that one."
EMMA," Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time. I mean, if there’s nothing more .."
SHERLOCK, I know what happened to your son.
EMMA, You do?
SHERLOCK," It’s quite simple. Superficial, to be blunt. But first, tell me: the night of the break-in. This room was in darkness?"
DAVID," Well, yes."
SHERLOCK," And the porch where it was smashed: I noticed the motion sensor was damaged, so I assume it’s permanently lit."
LESTRADE, How’d you notice that?
SHERLOCK, I lack the arrogance to ignore details. I’m not the police.
JOHN, So you’re saying he smashed it where he could see it.
SHERLOCK, Exactly.
JOHN, Why?
SHERLOCK, Dunno. Wouldn’t be fun if I knew.
DAVID, Yes.
SHERLOCK, No.
DAVID, No?
SHERLOCK," The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video. Easily arranged."
SHERLOCK, The trick was meant to be a surprise.
DAVID, Trick?
SHERLOCK, Obviously.
CHARLIE, Could you take a photo and send it? (He grins.)
SHERLOCK," There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car: one the actual passenger seat; the other a good copy. Well, good enough."
SHERLOCK, Effectively a costume.
DAVID, You’re joking.
SHERLOCK," No, I’m not. What he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise."
CHARLIE, Surprise!
SHERLOCK, That’s when it happened.
SHERLOCK," I can’t be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure. You said he’d felt unwell?"
DAVID, You all right?
SHERLOCK," He died there and then. No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained in the driver’s seat hidden until ..."
SHERLOCK," When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who’d been sitting there quite dead for a week."
EMMA," Oh, God!"
LESTRADE, Poor kid.
SHERLOCK," Really, I’m so sorry. Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough."
SHERLOCK, This is where it was smashed.
LESTRADE, That was amazing.
SHERLOCK, What?
LESTRADE," The car, the kid."
SHERLOCK, Ancient history. Why are you still talking about it?
JOHN, What’s so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
JOHN," Yeah, doesn’t mean you have to pull on it."
SHERLOCK," What kind of a life would that be? Besides, I have the strangest feeling."
JIM, Miss me?
SHERLOCK, That’s mine. You two take a ... bus.
SHERLOCK," I need to concentrate, and I don’t want to hit you."
SHERLOCK," The Mall, please."
MYCROFT, I met her once.
SHERLOCK, Thatcher? 
MYCROFT," Rather arrogant, I thought."
SHERLOCK, You thought that?!
MYCROFT, I know!
MYCROFT, Why am I looking at this?
MYCROFT," Oh, I see. (He looks at the picture.) Yes. (He smiles in a fake way.) Looks very ... (he pauses as he struggles for an appropriate term) ... fully functioning."
SHERLOCK, Is that really the best you can do?
MYCROFT, Sorry. I’ve never been very good with them.
SHERLOCK, Babies?
SHERLOCK, Moriarty. Did he have any connection with Thatcher? Any interest in her?
MYCROFT, Why on earth would he?
MYCROFT," In the last year of his life, James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over seventy assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias – which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical."
SHERLOCK, It’s a pearl. Get another one.
SHERLOCK, I’m sure. Maybe it’s Moriarty. Maybe it’s not. But something’s coming.
MYCROFT," Are you having a premonition, brother mine?"
SHERLOCK," The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other. What we call premonition is just movement of the web. If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable, as inevitable as mathematics."
MYCROFT, Appointment in Samarra.
SHERLOCK, I’m sorry?
MYCROFT, The merchant who can’t outrun Death. You always hated that story as a child. Less keen on predestination back then.
SHERLOCK, I’m not sure I like it now.
MYCROFT," You wrote your own version, as I remember. Appointment in Sumatra. The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine."
SHERLOCK," Goodnight, Mycroft. (He turns towards the door.)"
SHERLOCK, Keep me informed.
MYCROFT, Of what?
VOICE, Ammo!
VOICE, Ammo!
LESTRADE," Oh, hi, Stella."
HOPKINS, Greg.
LESTRADE," You, uh ... you, um ... (He makes incoherent noises and points to the closed door.)"
HOPKINS," Uh, yeah. He’s just got a client, so ..."
LESTRADE," R-right, right, right."
LESTRADE," Uh, so see a lot of each other, do you?"
LESTRADE," No, no."
HOPKINS, I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
LESTRADE," Yeah, ’course."
HOPKINS," I mean, he loves a really tricky case."
HOPKINS," Well, uh, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so ..."
LESTRADE," The Borgia Pearl. Are they ... they still after that, are they?"
HOPKINS," Yeah. So how did, uh, you two first meet?"
LESTRADE," Oh, it was a-a case about, um, ten years ago nobody could figure out. There was an old lady found dead in a sauna."
HOPKINS, Oh yeah? How’d she die?
LESTRADE, Hypothermia.
LESTRADE," I know! But then I met Sherlock. (His voice gets louder.) It was so simple, the way ..."
SHERLOCK, Will you two please keep it down?
LESTRADE, Sorry.
HOPKINS, Sorry.
SHERLOCK," Now, you haven’t always been in life insurance, have you? You started out in manual labour."
SHERLOCK," Oh, don’t bother being astonished. Your right hand’s almost an entire size bigger than your left."
Glove Size,” and superimposed above his hands are the numbers “10½” over the right hand and “9½” over the other.)
SHERLOCK, Hard manual work does that.
KINGSLEY," I was a carpenter, uh, like me dad."
SHERLOCK," And you’re trying to give up smoking, unsuccessfully, and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about."
KINGSLEY, Ah. E-cigarettes.
SHERLOCK," Not just that – ten individual e-cigarettes. Now, if you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would have invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things, but you’re convinced you can give up, so you don’t want to buy a pipe because that means you’re not serious about quitting, so instead you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last. Anything to add, John?"
SHERLOCK, John?
JOHN," Er, yeah, yeah, listening."
SHERLOCK, Don’t be so hard on yourself.
SHERLOCK, You know I value your little contributions.
JOHN, Yeah? It’s been there since nine this morning.
SHERLOCK, Has it? Where were you?
JOHN, Helping Mrs H with her Sudoku.
KINGSLEY, What about my girlfriend?
SHERLOCK, What?
KINGSLEY, You said I had an ex.
SHERLOCK, You’ve got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name ‘Akako.’
SHERLOCK, It’s obvious you’ve tried to have it removed.
SHERLOCK," If she’d really hurt your feelings, you would have had the word obliterated, but the first attempt wasn’t successful and you haven’t tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference."
KINGSLEY, Sorry. I-I thought you’d done something clever.
KINGSLEY," No, no. Ah, but now you’ve explained it, it’s dead simple, innit?"
SHERLOCK," I’ve withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it’s time you knew the truth."
KINGSLEY, What d’you mean?
SHERLOCK, Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
KINGSLEY, Well ...
SHERLOCK, You thought she was having an affair. I’m afraid it’s far worse than that. Your wife is a spy. 
KINGSLEY, What?!
SHERLOCK," That’s right. Her real name is Greta Bengtsdotter. (He goes into quick fire mode.) Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world. She’s been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife for one reason only: to get near the American embassy which is across the road from your flat. Tomorrow the US president will be at the embassy as part of an official state visit. As the president greets members of staff, Greta Bengtsdotter, disguised as a twenty-two stone cleaner, will inject the president in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit. This drug will then render the president entirely susceptible to the will of their new master, none other than James Moriarty. "
KINGSLEY, What?!
JOHN, Are you serious?
SHERLOCK," No, of course not. (He stands up and walks towards the door.) His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie."
KINGSLEY, I don’t!
KINGSLEY, Just the bras.
JOHN," So. What’s this all about, then?"
SHERLOCK, Having fun.
JOHN, Fun?
SHERLOCK, While I can.
JOHN, Mm-hm.
HOPKINS," Uh, Sherlock ..."
HOPKINS," Uh, but, uh ..."
SHERLOCK, Go!
SHERLOCK," Oh, this had better be good."
LESTRADE," Oh, I think you’ll like it."
JOHN," That is the bust, isn’t it? The one that was broken."
LESTRADE," No, it isn’t. It’s another one; different owner, different part of town. You were right! This is a ... this is a thing. Something’s going on."
LESTRADE, What’s wrong? I thought you’d be pleased.
SHERLOCK, I am pleased.
LESTRADE, You don’t look pleased.
SHERLOCK, And the game is on. 
LESTRADE, Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one: one belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan ...
JOHN, Identical busts?
LESTRADE, Yeah; and this one to a Doctor Barnicot in Holborn. Three in total. (He looks at his watch.) God knows who’d wanna do something like this.
JOHN," Yeah, well some people have that complex, don’t they – an idée fixe. (Walking closer to the table he looks pointedly at Sherlock.) They obsess over one thing and they can’t let it go."
SHERLOCK, Ooh.
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK," Blood. (He puts the plaster under the ’scope and looks at it through the lenses.) Quite a bit of it, too."
SHERLOCK, Was there any injury at the crime scene?
LESTRADE, Nah. (He looks at his watch again.)
SHERLOCK, Come on.
LESTRADE, Holborn?
SHERLOCK, Lambeth.
LESTRADE, Lambeth? Why?
SHERLOCK, To see Toby.
JOHN," Ah, right. Who?"
SHERLOCK, You’ll see.
JOHN, Right. (To Greg) You coming? 
SHERLOCK, No. He’s got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn’t want to be late for. (He gets up and starts putting on his jacket.)
LESTRADE, Who told you?
SHERLOCK, The right sleeve of your jacket ... (A close-up shows that there are long human hairs on the sleeve) ... plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne ... 
SHERLOCK, ... and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch. Have a good time.
LESTRADE, I will.
SHERLOCK," Trust me, though, she’s not right for you."
LESTRADE," Well, thank you, Mystic Meg(!)"
JOHN, How’d you work all that out? 
JOHN, Are you just making this up?
SHERLOCK, Possibly.
JOHN, Who’s Toby?
JOHN," So, how does that help us?"
SHERLOCK, What?
JOHN, Toby the hacker.
SHERLOCK, Toby’s not the hacker.
JOHN, What?
SHERLOCK," All right, Craig?"
JOHN, So I see.
MARY, Hiya!
JOHN," Mary, what are you ...?"
JOHN," No, we-we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case."
MARY," No, exactly, so ... (she hands the baby to John) ... don’t wait up. (She looks across to Sherlock.) Hey, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK, Hey.
JOHN," But ... Mary, what are you doing here?"
SHERLOCK, She’s better at this than you.
JOHN, Better?
SHERLOCK, So I texted her.
JOHN, Hang on. Mary’s better than me?
SHERLOCK," Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill set. Of course she’s better."
JOHN," Yeah, okay."
SHERLOCK, Nothing personal.
JOHN," What, so I’m supposed to just go home now, am I?"
MARY," Oh, what do you think, Sherlock? Shall we take him with us?"
SHERLOCK, John or the dog?
JOHN," Ha-ha, that’s funny."
MARY, He’s handy and loyal.
JOHN, That’s hilarious.
SHERLOCK, Mm.
MARY," Aww! (Smiling, she points to herself.)"
SHERLOCK," Barnicot’s house, then. Anyone up for a trudge?"
SHERLOCK, Keep up. He’s fast.
JOHN, He’s not moving.
SHERLOCK, He’s thinking.
JOHN, He’s really not moving.
SHERLOCK," Slow but sure, John; not dissimilar to yourself."
JOHN," You just like this dog, don’t you?"
SHERLOCK," Well, I like you."
SHERLOCK, Fascinating.
H," GROUP A -VE.’ On they go, Toby now smelling the chemical elements of ‘WHISKEY’ as they run past a church."
SHERLOCK, Well? What do you make of it?
MARY, They were looking for something.
SHERLOCK," Yes, but it wasn’t a burglar. They came specifically for that Thatcher bust. Why?"
SHERLOCK, Clever.
MARY," Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail, where would you go?"
JOHN, Like hiding a tree in a forest.
SHERLOCK, Or blood in a butchers’.
SHERLOCK," Never mind, Toby. Better luck next time, hm?"
SHERLOCK," This is it, though. This is the one. (He stands up.) I can feel it."
JOHN, Not Moriarty?
SHERLOCK," It has to be him. It’s too bizarre; it’s too baroque. (He continues to look around the area, his face alight with excitement.) It’s designed to beguile me, tease me, lure me in. At last – a noose for me to put my neck into."
MARY, You should have seen the state of the front room. It was like ‘The Exorcist.’
JOHN, Hm! Was Rosie’s head spinning round?
MARY, No. Just the projectile vomiting.
JOHN, Nice(!)
MARY," Hm! No, you’d think we’d have noticed when she was born."
JOHN, Hm? Noticed what?
MARY, The little ‘666’ on her forehead.
JOHN, That’s ‘The Omen.’
MARY, So?
JOHN," Well, you said it was like ‘The Exorcist.’ They’re two different things. She can’t be the Devil and the Antichrist."
MARY," Yeah, can’t she?"
MARY," Coming, darling."
MARY, Mummy’s coming.
CRAIG," Have you heard of that thing, in Germany?"
SHERLOCK," You’re going to have to be more specific, Craig."
CRAIG," ‘Ostalgie.’ People who miss the old days under the Communists. People are weird, aren’t they?"
SHERLOCK, Mm. (He narrows his eyes momentarily.)
CRAIG," According to this, there’s quite a market for Cold War memorabilia – Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin. (He smiles.) Time’s a great leveller, innit? Thatcher’s like – I dunno – Napoleon now."
CRAIG, I’ve got into the records of the suppliers – Gelder & Co. Seems they’re from Georgia.
SHERLOCK, Where exactly?
CRAIG," Uh, Tbilisi. Batch of six."
CRAIG, One to Welsborough; one to Hassan; one to Doctor Barnicot. Two to Miss Orrie Harker ...
CRAIG, ... one to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
SHERLOCK," Lestrade, another one?"
SHERLOCK, Harker or Sandeford?
LESTRADE, Harker. And it’s murder this time.
SHERLOCK," Hm, that perks things up a bit."
LESTRADE, Defensive wounds on her face and hands. Throat cut – sharp blade.
SHERLOCK, The same thing inside the house? The bust?
LESTRADE, Two of them this time.
SHERLOCK, Interesting. That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago – limited edition of six.
LESTRADE, And now someone’s wandering about destroying ’em all. Makes no sense. What’s the point?
SHERLOCK," No, they’re not destroying them. That’s not what’s happening."
LESTRADE, Yes it is.
SHERLOCK," Well, it is what’s happening, but it’s not the point. I’ve been slow; far too slow."
LESTRADE," Well, I’m still being slow over here, so if you wouldn’t mind ..."
SHERLOCK," Slow but lucky; very lucky. And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold. Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I’m going next. Congratulations, by the way."
LESTRADE, I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK," Well, you’re about to solve a big one."
LESTRADE," Yeah, until John publishes his blog."
SANDEFORD," That’s enough now, love."
SANDEFORD," Daddy has things to do, I’m afraid."
SANDEFORD, And you need to get to bed! Come on!
SHERLOCK, Wouldn’t it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
SHERLOCK, You were on the run; nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
SHERLOCK," You find yourself in a workshop. Plaster busts of The Iron Lady drying. It’s clever, very clever. But now you’ve met me, and you’re not so clever, are you?"
THE INTRUDER, Who are you?
SHERLOCK, My name is Sherlock Holmes.
THE INTRUDER," Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes."
SHERLOCK," You’re out of time. Tell me about your boss, Moriarty."
THE INTRUDER, You think you understand. You understand nothing.
SHERLOCK," Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don’t we just enjoy the moment?"
SHERLOCK, Let me present Interpol’s number one case. Too tough for them; too boring for me.
SHERLOCK, The Black Pearl of the Borgias.
MARY, Everything about who I was is on there.
SHERLOCK, I don’t understand.
SHERLOCK, She ... she destroyed it.
THE INTRUDER, “She.”
THE INTRUDER, You know her.
THE INTRUDER," You do, don’t you? You know the bitch. She betrayed me; betrayed us all."
SHERLOCK, Mary. This is about Mary.
THE INTRUDER," Is that what she’s calling herself now, eh?"
THE INTRUDER, Give it to me.
THE INTRUDER," Nobody shoots me! Anyone shoots, I kill this man!"
THE INTRUDER, You’re policemen. I’m a professional.
THE INTRUDER, Tell her she’s a dead woman. She’s a dead woman walking.
SHERLOCK, Not a policeman.
AMBASSADOR, What do you think? Mate in two?
HUSBAND," Don’t antagonise them, darling."
AMBASSADOR," Oh, what else is there to do? Chess palls after three months."
AMBASSADOR, Everything palls.
HUSBAND, They’ll send someone soon.
AMBASSADOR," “They”? Who are “they”? Seems to me we’ve put an awful lot of faith in “they.” Well, I’ve got something “they” would dearly love if only we could get out of here."
AMBASSADOR, I’ve got Ammo.
HUSBAND, Ammo?
MARY, Madam Ambassador.
AMBASSADOR, What took you so long?
MARY, Can’t get the staff.
OPERATIVE, Everyone out! Now!
THAT MAN, What now? What do we do?
MARY, We die.
SHERLOCK, Well?
LESTRADE, He can’t have got far. We’ll have him in a bit.
SHERLOCK, I very much doubt it.
LESTRADE, Why?
GOLD TEETH MAN, Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.
GOLD TEETH MAN, Ammo. Ammo. Ammo-o-o-o-o.
GUARD, What would you do to a traitor?  Maybe we’ll tell him one day. If he lives that long.
s note," one of my beta team flailed over the fact that the unseen person being flogged was tall and thin and had long floppy hair. When she pointed it out to me I joined in with the flailing, remembering someone else of that description who got himself beaten in a foreign country. Additionally, during later footage of the same embassy firefight we see glimpses of both of the other team members, and each of them has short hair."
home," there’s a tatty sofa and a couple of hard plastic chairs, and a couple of desks, one of which has an open laptop and anglepoise lamp on it. A few other lights are dotted around the room but it’s still quite dark in there. The person pushes back the hood of their coat and we realise that it’s Mary. "
SHERLOCK," I was so convinced it was Moriarty, I couldn’t see what was right under my nose."
SHERLOCK, I expected a pearl.
MARY, Oh my God. That’s a ...
SHERLOCK," Yes, it’s an AGRA memory stick like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else. Who?"
SHERLOCK," I glanced at it, but I’d prefer to hear it from you."
MARY, Why?
SHERLOCK, Because I’ll know the truth when I hear it.
MARY, There were four of us. Agents.
SHERLOCK, Not just agents.
MARY, Polite term. Alex; Gabriel; me; and Ajay.
MARY," There was absolute trust between us. The memory sticks guaranteed it. We all had one, each containing aliases, our background, everything. We could never be betrayed because we had everything we needed to destroy the other."
SHERLOCK, Who employed you?
MARY," Anyone who paid well. I mean, we were at the top of our game for years, and then it all ended. There was a coup in Georgia. The British embassy in Tbilisi was taken over; lots of hostages. We got the call to go in, get them out. There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment."
SHERLOCK, Who from?
MARY," I don’t know. Just another voice on the phone, and a code word, “Ammo.”"
SHERLOCK, “Ammo”?
MARY," Like ‘ammunition.’ We went in, but then something went wrong. Something went really wrong."
SHERLOCK, No.
MARY, What?
SHERLOCK, I met someone tonight: the same someone who’s looking for the sixth Thatcher.
MARY," Oh my God. That’s Ajay. That’s him. What, he’s alive?"
SHERLOCK," Yeah, very much so. (He touches his hand to the bruise under his eye.)"
MARY, Where is he? I need to see him now!
MARY," Yeah, of course. It was our insurance. Above all, they mustn’t fall into enemy hands."
SHERLOCK," So Ajay survived as well, and now he’s looking for the memory stick he managed to hide with all of AGRA’s old aliases on it. But why?"
MARY, I don’t know!
SHERLOCK, Tbilisi was six years ago. Where’s he been?
SHERLOCK," Mary, I’m sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead."
SHERLOCK, I heard it from his own mouth. “Tell her she’s a dead woman walking.”
MARY, Why would he want to kill me?
SHERLOCK, He said you betrayed him.
MARY," Oh, no, no, that’s insane."
SHERLOCK," Well, it’s what he believes."
MARY, I suppose I was always afraid this might happen; that something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
SHERLOCK," Yes, well he’s a very tangible ghost."
MARY," God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it. "
SHERLOCK, To look after the three of you.
MARY, Sherlock the dragon slayer.
MARY, There’s something I think you should read.
SHERLOCK, What is it?
MARY, I hoped I wouldn’t have to do this.
SHERLOCK, What are you ...?
SHERLOCK," Oh, no."
MARY," It’s all right. It’s for the best, believe me."
MARY, You just look after them ’til I get back. I’m sorry.
s note," a later episode confirms the lyrics of the song, which are:"
MYCROFT," Agra? A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is three hundred and seventy-eight kilometres west of the state capital, Lucknow ..."
SHERLOCK, AGRA is an acronym.
MYCROFT," Oh, good. I love an acronym. All the best secret societies have them."
SHERLOCK," Team of agents, the best. But you know all that."
MYCROFT, Of course I do. Go on.
SHERLOCK," One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team."
MYCROFT," Indeed? Well, that’s news to me."
SHERLOCK, He’s already killed looking for that memory stick. AGRA always worked for the highest bidder. I thought that might include you.
SHERLOCK," Well, I mean the British government or whatever government you’re currently propping up."
MYCROFT, AGRA were very reliable; then came the Tbilisi incident. They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong. And that was that. We stopped using freelancers.
SHERLOCK, Your initiative?
MYCROFT, My initiative. Freelancers are too woolly; too messy. I don’t like loose ends – not on my watch.
SHERLOCK," There was something else; a detail, a code word."
 The overlaid text on the screen flips to show the letters in reverse, “OMMA.” Mycroft frowns at the notepad.)
MYCROFT, “AMMO”?
SHERLOCK, It’s all I’ve got.
MYCROFT, Little enough.
SHERLOCK," Could you do some digging, as a favour?"
MYCROFT," And if you can find who’s after her and neutralise them, what then? You think you can go on saving her forever?"
MYCROFT, Is that sentiment talking?
SHERLOCK, No. It’s me.
MYCROFT, Difficult to tell the difference these days.
SHERLOCK," Told you: I made a promise, a vow."
 brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age. They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
MARY, Pardon me. I can hear a squeaking. Can you hear a squeaking?
MARY, Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
MARY, “Why Planes Fail.” Did you see it?
PASSENGER, Can’t say I did.
MARY," Oh, truly terrifying. Swore I would never fly again, yet here I am!"
FLIGHT ATTENDANT," Everything okay, madam?"
MARY," No! No, no, it’s not, but then what’s the use in complaining? I hear a squeaking. Probably the wing’ll come off, is all."
FLIGHT ATTENDANT," Everything’s fine, I promise you. Just relax."
MARY," It was okay, I guess, but did somebody hide the sun? (She takes off her sunglasses.) Did you lose it in the war?"
MARY, I think I’m dying. I don’t feel so good.
MARY," Oh ... (she reaches out and cup’s the woman’s cheek) ... you’re sweet. (She strokes her cheek.) You have a very kind face. God will smile on you. (She grizzles, then raises her other hand towards her mouth."
s note, a million thanks to the two anonymous commenters who pointed out that the boat from which Mary disembarks is named “Flekkete Bånd” which deliciously translates from Norwegian to “Speckled Band”; and that the name of the boat behind it is “Løvens Manke” which translates to “Lion’s Mane.” Sometimes I could hug Mofftiss so hard that their eyes would pop out of their heads.]
KARIM," Master Bun. It’s not a set without him. How many more times, Mr Sherlock?"
SHERLOCK, Happy families.
SHERLOCK, Nice trip?
MARY, How the f...
MARY, How did you get in here?!
SHERLOCK, Karim let me in.
KARIM, Hello.
SHERLOCK," Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?"
KARIM, Sure.
SHERLOCK, Thank you.
KARIM," Nice to meet you, missus."
MARY," No, really, though, how? Every movement I made was entirely random; every new personality just on the roll of a dice!"
SHERLOCK," Mary, no human action is ever truly random. (Quick fire) An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual can reduce the number of variables considerably."
SHERLOCK," But they’re really difficult, so instead I just ... stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick."
MARY," Oh, you bastard!"
MARY, You bastard!
SHERLOCK," I know, but your face!"
MARY, “The mathematics of probability”?!
SHERLOCK, You believed that.
SHERLOCK, Yes. I started to run out about then.
MARY, In the memory stick!
JOHN, AGRA.
MARY, Yes.
JOHN, Mm-hm. You said it was your initials.
MARY," In a way, that was true."
JOHN, In a way?
JOHN, So many lies.
MARY, I’m so sorry.
JOHN, I don’t just mean you.
MARY, What?
JOHN," Alex, Gabriel, Ajay ... You’re ‘R.’"
JOHN, Rosamund.
MARY, I always liked ‘Mary.’
JOHN, I used to.
MARY, I ju... I didn’t know what else to do.
s what couples are supposed to do, work things through.
MARY," Yes. (She nods.) Yes, of course."
MARY," All the time. You’re always a good man, John. I’ve never doubted that. You never judge; you never complain. I don’t deserve you. I ... "
MARY," All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that’s all."
SHERLOCK, I will keep you safe.
SHERLOCK," Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you."
SHERLOCK, Get down!
AJAY, Hello again.
MARY, Ajay?
AJAY," Oh, you remember me. I’m touched."
MARY," Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did."
AJAY, I’ve been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
MARY," I swear to you, I thought you were dead. I thought I was the only one who got out."
SHERLOCK, How did you find us?
AJAY," By following you, Sherlock Holmes. I mean, you’re clever – you found her – but I found you, so perhaps not so clever. And now here we are, at last."
AJAY, Touché.
JOHN," Listen: whatever you think you know, we can talk about this. We can work it out."
AJAY, She thought I was dead. I might as well have been.
MARY," It was always just the four of us, always, remember?"
AJAY, Oh yeah.
MARY, So why d’you want to kill me?
AJAY, D’you know how long they kept me prisoner; what they did to me? They tortured Alex to death. (He breathes out a brief sigh.) I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
AJAY," But you, you – where were you?"
MARY," That day at the embassy, I escaped."
MARY," But I lost sight of you too, so you explain: where were you?"
AJAY," Oh, I got out ... for a while."
AJAY, Long enough to hide my memory stick.
AJAY, I didn’t want that to fall into their hands.
AJAY," I was loyal, you see; loyal to my friends. But they took me, tortured me. Not for information."
AJAY, Not for anything except fun.
AJAY," Oh, they thought I’d give in, die, but I didn’t. I lived, and eventually they forgot about me just rotting in a cell somewhere. Six years they kept me there, until one day I saw my chance. Oh, and I-I made them pay. You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things – little whispers, laughter, gossip: how the clever agents had been betrayed."
AJAY, Brought down by you.
MARY, Me?
AJAY, I’ve dreamed of killing you every night for six years ...
MARY," I swear to you, Ajay."
AJAY, What did I hear?
AJAY, Ammo. Every day as they tore into me. Ammo. Ammo. (His voice starts to tremble.) Ammo. (He takes in a shaky breath.) Ammo.
SHERLOCK, And they said it was her?
AJAY," Yeah, they said it was the English woman."
MARY, No! No!
MYCROFT, Couldn’t this wait until you’re back?
MYCROFT," Ammo, yes, you said."
SHERLOCK," How’s your Latin, brother dear?"
SHERLOCK," Amo, amas, amat."
SHERLOCK," Not ‘ammo’ as in ‘ammunition’ but ‘amo,’ meaning ...?"
MYCROFT," You’d better be right, Sherlock."
LADY SMALLWOOD, Bloody thing.
LADY SMALLWOOD, What’s going on?
SIR EDWIN," I’m very sorry, Lady Smallwood. Your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded."
LADY SMALLWOOD, What?!
 they are not sitting side by side," Mary is in the aisle seat with her head propped up on one hand and her eyes closed, and John is in the window seat looking towards the window. His own voice sounds in his head. "
s VOICE, So many lies. I don’t just mean you.
JOHN, Ah. Hello.
WOMAN, I like your daisy!
JOHN," Thank you, yeah. It’s not really me, though, I don’t think."
WOMAN, No?
JOHN, No.
JOHN," No, it’s too floral for me. I’m more of a knackered-with-weary-old-eyes kind of guy."
WOMAN," Well, I think they’re nice. (She pauses, looking a little awkward, but then presses on.) Nice eyes."
WOMAN," Look, look ... I don’t normally do this but, um ... "
JOHN, But you’re gonna.
JOHN, What’s this?
WOMAN," This is me. (She hands him the paper and backs away, smiling nervously and rubbing the back of her head while keeping her eyes fixed on the paper John’s holding.)"
JOHN, Thank you. Cheers.
JOHN, ’Bye.
 The woman has written, 
MARY," No, you’d think we’d have noticed when she was born."
JOHN, Hm? Noticed what?
MARY, The little ‘666’ on her forehead.
JOHN, That’s ‘The Omen.’
MARY, So?
JOHN," Well, you said it was like ‘The Exorcist.’ They’re two different things. She can’t be the Devil and the Antichrist."
MARY," Yeah, can’t she?"
MARY," Coming, darling."
MARY, I’m coming.
 The message reads, 
John looks back to his phone and types, 
 the reply comes back, 
 then goes back to the phone and types, 
 Then a new message comes in, 
 John types, 
The reply comes back almost immediately, 
 I know, shall we go see Daddy?
JOHN, I’ll take her.
MARY, Yeah.
JOHN," Come here, Rose."
MARY, Yeah!
JOHN," Come here, darling. It’s all right."
MARY," Ah, thank you."
 John types a new message into his phone, 
 stops a couple of paces away and adds, 
s note," For the sake of completeness, I should add that an advertising hoarding on the bus stop shows something which is almost definitely a flag for something in one or both of the future episodes. If you’re avoiding potential spoilers, skip to the next paragraph."
LADY SMALLWOOD, This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it. How many more times?
MYCROFT," Six years ago you held the brief for foreign operations, code name “Love.”"
LADY SMALLWOOD," And you’re basing all this on a code name? On a whispered voice on the telephone? Come on, Mycroft."
MYCROFT," You were the conduit for AGRA. Every assignment, every detail, they got from you."
LADY SMALLWOOD, It was my job.
LADY SMALLWOOD, Yes.
MYCROFT, And they were betrayed.
LADY SMALLWOOD," Mycroft, we’ve known each other a long time. I promise you, I haven’t the foggiest idea what all this is about. You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers. (Slowly, emphatically) I haven’t done any of the things you’re accusing me of. Not one. (Even more emphatically) Not. One."
JOHN, D’you think she’ll like bedtime stories? I’d like to do those.
JOHN," Yeah, I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment – although she does seem to enjoy ’em."
MARY," Well, I’ll have to give that a go!"
 his gaze distant and his eyes rapidly flickering back and forth as various memories come to him, 
AJAY, You think you understand. You understand nothing.
MYCROFT," Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love ... "
MARY, You’d be amazed what a receptionist picks up. 
MARY, They know everything. 
AJAY, They said it was the English woman. 
MYCROFT, Don’t minute any of this. 
MARY, They know everything. 
MARY," You don’t make it easy, do you?"
JOHN, What d’you mean?
JOHN, Mary ... I-I need to tell you ...
MARY, Hang on.
s message reads, 
MARY, Can you tell me later?
JOHN, Yeah.
MARY, Great.
JOHN, Yeah.
MARY," Well, no, we can’t just go."
JOHN, Rosie.
MARY, Yeah.
MARY, No!
JOHN," I’ll, um, come as soon as I’ve found someone. Mrs Hudson."
MARY, Corfu ’til Saturday.
MARY, Molly.
JOHN," Uh, yeah, I’ll try. (He starts typing.)"
MARY," Well, we should both stay and wait for her."
JOHN," You know that’s not gonna happen. If there’s more to this case, you’re the one who needs to see it."
MARY," Yeah, okay. You win."
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT," Ladies and gentlemen, the Aquarium will be closing in five minutes. Please make your way to the exit. Thank you."
SHERLOCK, Your office said I’d find you here.
VIVIAN," This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet. (She continues looking forward into a tank of sharks and other smaller fish.) We’re like them: ghostly, living in the shadows. "
SHERLOCK, Predatory.
VIVIAN," Well, it depends which side you’re on. (She turns away to look into the shark tank again.) Also, we have to keep moving or we die."
SHERLOCK, Nice location for the final act. Couldn’t have chosen it better myself. But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
VIVIAN, I just come here to look at the fish.
VIVIAN, I knew this would happen one day.
VIVIAN, It’s like that old story.
SHERLOCK, I really am a very busy man. Would you mind cutting to the chase?
VIVIAN," You’re very sure of yourself, aren’t you?"
VIVIAN, There was once a merchant in a famous market in Baghdad.
SHERLOCK, I really have never liked this story.
VIVIAN, I’m just like the merchant in the story. I thought I could outrun the inevitable. I’ve always been looking over my shoulder; always expecting to see the grim figure of ...
MARY, ... Death.
MARY, Hey.
SHERLOCK, John?
MARY, On his way.
SHERLOCK, Let me introduce Amo.
SHERLOCK, Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
VIVIAN, Why does anyone do anything?
SHERLOCK," Oh, let me guess. Selling secrets?"
VIVIAN," Well, it would be churlish to refuse. Worked very well for a few years. I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it. But the ambassador in Tbilisi found out. I thought I’d had it. (She looks towards Mary before returning her gaze to Sherlock.) Then she was taken hostage in that coup. (She laughs.) I couldn’t believe my luck! That bought me a little time."
SHERLOCK, But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
VIVIAN, Very handy. They were always such reliable killers.
SHERLOCK," What you didn’t know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers."
MARY, And you thought your troubles were over.
VIVIAN," I was tired; tired of the mess of it all. (She sighs.) I just wanted some peace, some clarity. The hostages were killed, AGRA too ... (she looks across to Mary) ... or so I thought. My secret was safe. But apparently not. Just a little peace. That’s all you wanted too, wasn’t it? A family, home. Really, I understand."
VIVIAN," So just let me get out of here, right? Let me just walk away. I’ll vanish. I’ll go forever. What d’you say?"
MARY, Okay.
VIVIAN, I was never a field agent. I always thought I’d be rather good.
SHERLOCK," Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well."
VIVIAN, Thanks.
SHERLOCK, ... for a secretary.
VIVIAN, What?
SHERLOCK," Can’t have been easy all those years, sitting in the back keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room."
VIVIAN, I didn’t do this out of jealousy!
SHERLOCK," No? Same old drudge, day in, day out, never getting out there where all the excitement was. Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street."
SHERLOCK, They’ve taken up the pavement outside the Post Office there. The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
SHERLOCK," Yes, your little flat."
VIVIAN, How do you know?
SHERLOCK," Two Burmese and a tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan."
MARY," Sherlock, don’t."
 too," the slight tremor in your hand ... (there’s a close-up of her slightly shaking gun hand, then a close-up of her mouth) ... the red wine stain ghosting your top lip. So yes. I say jealousy was your motive after all – to prove how good you are ..."
SHERLOCK, ... to make up for the inadequacies of your little life.
MYCROFT," Well, Mrs Norbury. I must admit this is unexpected."
VIVIAN," So it would seem. (She smiles a little.) You’ve seen right through me, Mr Holmes."
SHERLOCK, It’s what I do.
VIVIAN, Maybe I can still surprise you.
LESTRADE, Come on. (He points at her.) Be sensible.
VIVIAN," No, I don’t think so."
SHERLOCK, Everything’s fine. It’s gonna be okay.
SHERLOCK, Get an ambulance.
JOHN, Mary!
MARY, John!
JOHN, Mary? Mary?
JOHN, Stay with me. Stay with me.
MARY," Oh, come on."
JOHN," No, don’t worry. Don’t worry."
MARY," Oh, come on, Doctor, you can do better than that. "
JOHN," Come on, Mary."
JOHN," Mary, come on."
MARY," God, John, I think this is it."
JOHN," No-no-no-no, it’s not."
MARY, You made me so happy.
MARY," You gave me everything I could ever, ever ..."
JOHN, Shh-shh.
MARY, ... want.
JOHN," Mary, Mary ... (he gently shushes her, and runs his free hand over her forehead.)"
MARY, Promise me.
JOHN, I promise. I promise.
MARY, I ... so like you.
SHERLOCK," Yes. Yes, y-you did."
MARY, I’m sorry ... for shooting you that time. I’m really sorry.
MARY," I think we’re even now, okay?"
JOHN, Mary. Mary.
MARY, ... was the only life worth living.
MARY, Thank you.
ELLA, D’you want to talk about it?
ELLA," This is a two-way relationship, you know."
ELLA," The whole world has come crashing down around you. Everything’s hopeless, irretrievable. I know that’s what you must feel, but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me."
SHERLOCK, That’s not really my style.
SHERLOCK, I need to know what to do.
ELLA, Do?
MYCROFT," Put me through to Sherrinford, please. ... Yes, I’ll wait."
SHERLOCK, I’m afraid it won’t.
MRS HUDSON," We’ll have to rally round, I expect. Do our bit. (She breaks down in tears again.) Look after little Rosie."
SHERLOCK," Just going to, um ... (he looks around as if uncertain what to do, then points to a small pile of letters next to his open laptop on the dining table) ... look through these things. There might be a case."
MRS HUDSON, A case?
MRS HUDSON," Oh. You’re not up to it, are you?"
SHERLOCK," Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson."
MRS HUDSON," Yes, yes, I expect you’re right. (She starts to get out of the chair.) I’ll make some tea, shall I?"
SHERLOCK, Mrs Hudson?
SHERLOCK," If you ever think I’m becoming a bit ... (he pauses and swallows) ... full of myself, cocky or ... (he pulls in a breath) ... over-confident ..."
MRS HUDSON, Yes?
MRS HUDSON, Norbury.
SHERLOCK," Just that. (He pauses for a moment, lowering his gaze, then looks at her pleadingly.) I’d be very grateful."
SHERLOCK, What’s this?
MRS HUDSON," Oh, I brought that up. It was mixed up with my things. "
MRS HUDSON, Oh God. Is that ...
SHERLOCK, Must be.
MRS HUDSON, Oh!
MARY, Thought that would get your attention.
MRS HUDSON, Oh!
MARY," So, this is in case ... (she smiles awkwardly at the camera) ... in case the day comes. If you are watching this, I’m ... probably dead. I hope I can have an ordinary life, but who knows? Nothing’s certain; nothing’s written. My old life – it was full of consequences. (She smiles briefly.) The danger was the fun part, but you can’t outrun that forever. (She gestures towards the camera.) You need to remember that, so ... I’m giving you a case, Sherlock."
MARY, Might be the hardest case of your career. When I’m ... gone – if I’m gone – I need you to do something for me.
MOLLY," It’s, uh, it’s from John."
MOLLY, You don’t need to read it now.
MOLLY," I’m sorry, Sherlock. He says ... Jo-John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help ..."
SHERLOCK, Yes?
MARY, Save John Watson.
MARY," Save him, Sherlock."
MARY, Save him.
MARY," Go to Hell, Sherlock."
JOHN, I woke up.
THERAPIST, How did you sleep?
JOHN, I didn’t. I don’t.
THERAPIST, You just said you woke up.
JOHN, I stopped lying down.
THERAPIST," I meant Rosie, your daughter."
JOHN," Uh, she’s with friends."
THERAPIST, Why?
JOHN," Can’t always cope ... and, uh, last night wasn’t ... good."
THERAPIST, That’s understandable.
JOHN, Is it? Why? Why is it understandable? Why does everything have to be understandable?
JOHN," Why can’t, um, some things be unacceptable and-and we just say that?"
THERAPIST, I only mean it’s okay.
JOHN, I’m letting my daughter down. How the hell is that okay?
JOHN, And Rosie just lost her mother.
THERAPIST," So there is no-one you talk to, confide in?"
JOHN, No-one.
JOHN," Oh, I’m picking up Rosie this afternoon, after I’ve seen my therapist. Got a new one; seeing her today."
JOHN, ’Cause I can’t.
JOHN, Because I can’t ... you know I can’t. She thinks you’re dead. 
MARY, I am dead.
MARY," Please, for your own sake and for Rosie’s. This isn’t real. I’m dead."
MARY, John. Look at me.
JOHN, Hm. (He turns his head to her.)
MARY, I’m not here.
MARY," You know that, don’t you?"
JOHN, No.
THERAPIST, What are you looking at?
JOHN, Nothing.
JOHN," Oh, I suppose I was just ... looking away. (He laughs nervously.)"
THERAPIST, There is a difference between looking away and looking to. I tend to notice these things.
THERAPIST," Now I am reminding you of your friend, I think."
THERAPIST, Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?
JOHN, I haven’t seen him. No-one’s seen him. He’s locked himself away in his flat. God knows what he’s up to.
THERAPIST, Do you blame him?
JOHN, I don’t blame ... I don’t think about him. (He shakes his head.)
THERAPIST, Has he attempted to make contact with you?
JOHN, No.
THERAPIST, How can you be sure? He might have tried.
JOHN," No, if Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch, that’s not something you can fail to notice."
THERAPIST, ... won’t you introduce me?
CORNELIA, Mr Smith?
CORNELIA, Whenever you’re ready.
SMITH," Uh, the charity fun..."
SMITH," Now, please."
SMITH, It’s difficult having such good friends.
SMITH, Friends are people you want to share with. Friends and ...
SMITH, ... family.
IVAN, Something on your mind?
SMITH," Yes, Ivan. Oh, yes."
IVAN, Whatever you tell us stays in this room. I think I speak for everyone.
FAITH, Well? What is the worst thing you could do?
SMITH," Tell them your darkest secret. (He narrows his eyes.) Because if you tell them and they decide they’d rather not know, you can’t take it back. You can’t unsay it. (He smiles briefly.) Once you’ve opened your heart, you can’t close it again."
SMITH, I’m kidding!
SMITH, Of course you can.
SMITH," Well, everyone, please, roll up your right sleeves. Roll up your right sleeves. Come on."
SMITH," Oh, i-it’s, uh, it’s a bit of insurance."
FAITH, I don’t understand. (She points to the drug stand nearest to her.) What is that?
FAITH, One of yours?
IVAN," We make it, my company – TD12. Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals for minor surgical procedures. Interferes with ... "
IVAN, ... the memory.
SMITH," I-I-I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it."
IVAN," Well, I didn’t exactly know who you were going to be using it on."
FAITH, You mean you didn’t ask?
THE OTHER FEMALE GUEST, This is obscene.
SMITH," All I’m doing, Faith, dear ... (he walks behind her and turns her chair slightly so that she can look at him) ... is getting something off my chest ... (he bends and takes her right wrist) ... without getting it on yours."
SMITH," What you’re about to hear me say may horrify you, but you will forget it."
SMITH, These drip feeds will keep the drug in your bloodstreams at exactly the right levels.
SMITH, Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes. (More quietly) I’m afraid that some of the memories you’ve had up to this point might also be ...
SMITH, ... corrupted.
SMITH, I’m going to share something with you now; something personal and of importance to me.
SMITH," I have a need to confess, but you – I think – might have a need to forget. (He chuckles.) By the end of this, you’ll be free to go. And don’t worry – by the time you’re back in the outside world, you will not remember any of what you’ve heard."
FAITH, Ignorance is bliss.
SMITH," Well, what’s wrong with bliss?!"
SMITH," Please, be aware that one of you is a high-ranking police officer."
SMITH, One of you is a member of the judiciary.
SMITH, One of you sits on the board of a prominent broadcaster.
SMITH," Two of you work for me and one of you, of course, is my lovely daughter, Faith."
SMITH," You are the people I need to hear me. I have made millions, for myself, for the people round this table, for millions of people I’ve never even met."
s note, that date wasn’t on a Thursday in real life.]
SMITH," If life is a balance sheet – and I think it is – well, I believe I’m in credit!"
SMITH, But I have a situation that needs to be ... managed ...
SMITH, I have a problem ... and there is only one way that I can solve it.
SMITH, I’m terribly sorry.
SMITH, I need to kill someone.
SMITH, I need to kill someone.
SMITH, Faith.
SMITH," My dear, dear child."
SMITH," Dear, in five minutes you won’t even remember why you were crying."
SMITH, The others are all fine.
FAITH, I know.
SMITH," You know, they’ve gone down the pub. (He strokes her hair.) It’s all on me. "
SMITH," Oh, Faith. Don’t you think I should take that? It’s only going to upset you."
FAITH," ... my father told me he wanted to kill someone. One word, Mr Holmes ..."
FAITH, ... and it changed my world forever.
FAITH, Just one word.
SHERLOCK, What word?
SHERLOCK, What name?
FAITH, I can’t remember who my father wanted to kill ... (she looks down at her hands on top of her cane) ... and I don’t know if he ever did it.
SHERLOCK," Well, you’ve changed. You no longer top up your tan and your roots are showing."
SHERLOCK, Letting yourself go?
FAITH, Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?
SHERLOCK, No. Do you own an American car?
FAITH, I’m sorry?
FAITH, No. Why-why do you ask?
SHERLOCK," Not sure, actually. (He shrugs.) Probably just noticed something."
s note," ‘dmellieon’ on Tumblr suggested that the way that the ‘chalk’ disperses looks more like salt or sugar or could even be cocaine or powdered meth crystals. While I’m thrilled with that deduction, I’ll continue to refer to it as ‘chalk’ simply to save repeating lots of possible alternatives.]"
FAITH, Are you okay?
SHERLOCK, Cost-cutting’s clearly a priority for you. Look at the size of your kitchen: teeny-tiny. (He walks past her towards the right-hand window then turns back to her.) Must be a bit annoying when you’re such a keen cook.
FAITH, I don’t understand.
SHERLOCK, Hang on a minute ... (he turns to the window) ... I was looking out of the window. Why was I doing that?
FAITH, I don’t know!
SHERLOCK, Me either. Must have had a reason. (He shakes his head and turns around.) It’ll come back to me.
SHERLOCK, Presumably you downsized when you ... when you left your job ... (he raises the paper to his mouth and bites into the edge of it) ... and maybe when you ended your relationship.
FAITH, You can’t know that.
SHERLOCK," ’Course I can. There wasn’t anything physical going on, was there? (He holds up the paper and starts to run his fingers along the fold.) Quite some time, in fact."
SHERLOCK," There, see? It’s obvious."
SHERLOCK," Think I just did, didn’t I? (He nods.) I’m sure that was me. (He sniffs.)"
FAITH, How?
SHERLOCK," Dunno. (He gestures vaguely.) Just sort of ... happens, really. (He leans forward and lowers his head.) It’s ... like a reflex. I can’t stop it."
SHERLOCK, Coat.
FAITH, I don’t have a coat.
WIGGINS, Who you talkin’ to?
SHERLOCK, Piss off.
FAITH, So what do you think?
SHERLOCK, Of what?
FAITH, My case.
SHERLOCK," Oh, it’s way too weird for me. Go to the police; they’re really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff. Tell them I sent you; that ought to get a reaction."
SHERLOCK, Night-night.
FAITH, Please.
FAITH, I have no-one else to turn to.
SHERLOCK," Yes, but I’m very busy at the moment. I have to drink a cup of tea."
WIGGINS, Is “cup of tea” code?
SHERLOCK, It’s a cup of tea.
WIGGINS, Because you might prefer some ... (he makes air-quotes with the fingers of his right hand) ... “coffee.”
FAITH, You’re my last hope.
WIGGINS, What’s bad luck?
WIGGINS, I always ’ave bad luck. It’s congenital.
WIGGINS, That’s not rude. Congenital: it just means ...
SHERLOCK, Handbag!
SHERLOCK," Off it. (Sternly, emphatically) Off it."
FAITH, Sorry? (She limps back towards him.) What? What are you talking about?
FAITH, My skirt?
SHERLOCK, Those markings. Do you see them?
SHERLOCK," You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door but they’re on the left-hand side, so you weren’t driving; you were in the passenger seat."
FAITH, I came in a taxi.
SHERLOCK," No, I didn’t, so thank you for confirming my hypothesis. Don’t really need to check that the angle’s consistent with self-harm, do I?"
FAITH, No.
SHERLOCK, Then you can keep your scars. I want to see your handbag.
FAITH, Why?
SHERLOCK, It’s too heavy. You said I was your last hope and now you’re going out into the night with no plan on how you’re getting home ... and a gun.
SHERLOCK, Chips.
FAITH, Chips?
SHERLOCK," You’re suicidal. You’re allowed chips, trust me. It’s about the only perk."
SHERLOCK," I think I remember the way. (He points to the front door.) It’s through there, isn’t it?"
SHERLOCK," Yeah, well, I’ve got a friend with me, so ..."
MRS HUDSON, What friend?
SHERLOCK, ’Bye!
SHERLOCK, Come on.
SMITH," I’m Culverton Smith, and in this election year I’ll be voting ..."
MYCROFT, For God’s sake. I was talking to the prime minister.
MAN, He’s left his flat.
SHERLOCK," You see the fold in the middle? For the first few months you kept this hidden, folded inside a book."
SHERLOCK," Must have been a tightly packed shelf, going by the severity of the crease."
SHERLOCK, So obviously you were keeping it hidden from someone living in the same house at a level of intimacy where privacy could not be assumed.
SHERLOCK, Conclusion: relationship.
SHERLOCK," Not any more, though."
SHERLOCK, There’s a pinprick at the top of the paper.
SHERLOCK, For the past few months it’s been on open display on a wall. Conclusion: relationship is over.
SHERLOCK, The paper’s been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells ...
SHERLOCK," ... so it must have been on display in the kitchen. (He lifts the paper to his nose and sniffs it.) Lots of different spices. You’re suicidal, alone and strapped for cash, yet you’re still cooking to impress. You’re keen, then. The kitchen is the most public room in any house, but since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this, I have to assume you don’t have any. You’ve isolated yourself."
FAITH, Amazing.
SHERLOCK, I know.
FAITH, I meant the chips.
SHERLOCK, Let’s go for a walk.
MARY, You should answer it.
JOHN, It’s Mycroft.
MARY, Might be about Sherlock.
SHERLOCK, By instinct we place them at eye level where there’s natural light. 
SHERLOCK," Now look: the sun’s only struck the bottom two thirds ... (he draws his hand horizontally across the paper one third of the way down it) ... but the line is straight, so that means we know the paper is facing the window."
SHERLOCK, But because the top section is unaffected ... (he gestures to the piece of paper) ... we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.
SHERLOCK, If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky ...
SHERLOCK, ... then the paper would be equally faded top to bottom.
SHERLOCK," But no. It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith, so I’m betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor."
SHERLOCK, The room’s small.
FAITH, Oh.
FAITH, Big Brother is watching you!
SHERLOCK, Literally.
LADY SMALLWOOD, We can keep tabs. You didn’t have to come in.
MYCROFT, I was talking to the prime minister.
LADY SMALLWOOD," Oh, I see."
MYCROFT, What’s he doing? Why’s he just wandering about like a fool?
LADY SMALLWOOD," She died, Mycroft. He’s probably still in shock."
MYCROFT, Everybody dies. It’s the one thing human beings can be relied upon to do. How can it still come as a surprise to people?
MYCROFT," I have, I think, apologised extensively."
LADY SMALLWOOD, You haven’t made it up to me.
MYCROFT, And how am I supposed to do that?
SHERLOCK, I’m sorry?
FAITH, Sex. How did you know I wasn’t ... getting any?
SHERLOCK, It’s all about the blood.
SHERLOCK," This one comes from the very first night. You can see the pen marks over it. I think you discovered that pain stimulated your memory, so you tried it again later. I’m no expert, but I assume that since your lover failed to notice an increasing number of scars over a period of months, that the relationship was no longer intimate."
FAITH, How do you know he didn’t notice?
FAITH, Would he?
SHERLOCK, Wouldn’t he? Isn’t that what you people do?
FAITH," Well, that’s interesting."
SHERLOCK, What is?
FAITH, The way you think.
SHERLOCK, Superbly?
FAITH, Sweetly.
SHERLOCK, I’m not sweet; I’m just high.
SHERLOCK, This way.
FAITH, What? We just came that way.
SHERLOCK, I know. It’s a plan.
MYCROFT, What is it? What-what now?
MYCROFT, Is he with someone?
AGENT, Not sure. We keep losing visual. Mostly we’re tracking his phone.
SMITH, Don’t call us; we’ll call...
JOHN," Sorry, what?"
MYCROFT, Please phone me if he gets in contact. Thank you.
LADY SMALLWOOD, Do you still speak to Sherrinford?
MYCROFT, I get regular updates.
LADY SMALLWOOD, And?
FAITH, Are we gonna walk all night?
SHERLOCK, Possibly. It’s a long word.
FAITH, What is?
SHERLOCK, “Bollocks.”
EVAN DAVIS, Culverton Smith. All this charity work: what’s in it for you?
SHERLOCK, D’you know why I’m going to take your case? Because of the one impossible thing you’ve said.
FAITH, What impossible thing?
SHERLOCK, You said your life turned on one word.
FAITH, Yes: the name of the person my father wanted to kill.
SHERLOCK," That’s the impossible thing. Just that, right there."
FAITH, What’s impossible?
SHERLOCK," Names aren’t one word. They’re always at least two. Sherlock Holmes; Faith Smith; Santa Claus; Winston Churchill; Napoleon Bonaparte. Actually, just ‘Napoleon’ would do."
FAITH, Or Elvis?
SHERLOCK," Well, I think we can rule both of them out as targets."
FAITH," Okay, I got it wrong, then. It wasn’t only one word; it can’t have been."
SHERLOCK," And you remember quite distinctly that your whole life turned on one word, so that happened, I don’t doubt it, but how can that word be a name – a name you instantly recognised that tore your world apart?"
FAITH," Okay, well, how?"
SHERLOCK, No idea. Yet. (He draws in a breath.) But I don’t work for free.
FAITH, D’you take cash?
SHERLOCK," Not cash, no."
SHERLOCK," “Taking your own life.” Interesting expression. Taking it from who? Oh, once it’s over, it’s not you who’ll miss it."
SHERLOCK, Your own death is something that happens to everybody else.
SHERLOCK, Your life is not your own. (His voice becomes strained.) Keep your hands off it.
FAITH, You’re not what I expected. You’re ...
FAITH, Nicer.
SHERLOCK, Than who?
SHERLOCK," Sorry, I ..."
MOLLY, Anyone.
s VOICE, Than who?
FAITH, And what’s that?
SMITH, I need to kill someone.
SHERLOCK, Who?
SMITH, Anyone!
SHERLOCK, Of course!
SHERLOCK," He doesn’t want to kill one person; he wants to kill anyone. (He stares at Smith, his eyes wide.) He’s a serial killer!"
SHERLOCK, He could be.
SMITH, Anyone.
SHERLOCK, Why not? Why shouldn’t he be?
DRIVER," Hey, you! What’s the matter with you?"
DRIVER, Do you know where you are? Are you drunk?
WIGGINS, Shezza.
SHERLOCK, What are you doing here?
WIGGINS, You’ve ’ad too much ...
WIGGINS, ... an’ that’s me sayin’ this.
SMITH, Kill.
SHERLOCK, Serial killers.
SHERLOCK, ... powerful and necessary.
THERAPIST, ... won’t you introduce me?
POLICE OFFICER," Right, you there. Stop right where you are."
MRS HUDSON," Huh? What? (She stops momentarily, looking at the officer, then turns and continues towards the front door, holding out a hand towards John.)"
MRS HUDSON," Oh, John ..."
POLICE OFFICER, Do you have any idea what speed you were going at?
MRS HUDSON," Well, of course not. I was on the phone."
MRS HUDSON," Oh ... (she holds out a mobile phone to him) ... it’s for you, by the way."
POLICE OFFICER, The what?!
JOHN," Look at the state of you! Mrs H, what have you been doing?!"
JOHN, What’s happened?
WIGGINS, I’m out of ’ere.
WIGGINS, ’e’s lost it.
SHERLOCK, “... once more! 
SHERLOCK, “Or close the wall up ...
SHERLOCK, “... with our English dead! 
SHERLOCK, “... set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide.
SHERLOCK, “... to his full height!
SHERLOCK, “... whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
SHERLOCK," “And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture!"
SHERLOCK," “... which I doubt not, for there is none of you so mean and base ..."
SHERLOCK, “... that hath not noble lustre in your eyes!
SHERLOCK," “I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start!"
SHERLOCK, Can I have a cup of tea?
JOHN, Did you call the police?
MRS HUDSON, These pictures ...
MRS HUDSON," ... they’re that man on the telly, aren’t they?"
SHERLOCK, What pictures?
SHERLOCK," Oh, these pictures! (He gestures towards the fireplace with the pistol.) Oh, you can see them too. (For a second, he points the gun directly at her.) That’s good."
THERAPIST," This, I think, is relevant from this morning. "
THERAPIST, He’s publicly accused Mr Smith of being a serial killer.
SHERLOCK," Oh, for goodness’ sakes."
MRS HUDSON," You need to see him, John. You need to help him!"
MRS HUDSON," Because I tell you something, John Watson. You will not have me."
JOHN," Have you spoken to Mycroft, Molly, uh, anyone?"
JOHN," Yeah, look, okay, maybe, if I get a chance."
JOHN," I’ll try, if I’m in the area."
JOHN, I promise.
MRS HUDSON, Thank you!
MRS HUDSON," Right, then, mister. Now I need your handcuffs. I happen to know there’s a pair in the salad drawer. (She shrugs.) I’ve borrowed them before."
SHERLOCK, The woman’s out of control. I asked for a cup of tea!
JOHN, How did you get him in the boot?
MRS HUDSON, The boys from the café. 
MRS HUDSON," And d’you know why they dropped you, dear?"
MRS HUDSON, Because they know you.
SHERLOCK, Who’s this one? (He points at her while looking at John.) Is this a new person? I’m against new people.
JOHN, She’s my therapist.
SHERLOCK, Awesome! (He walks towards her.) D’you do block bookings?
JOHN, Whose car is that?
MRS HUDSON, That’s my car.
JOHN, How can that be your car?!
MRS HUDSON," ... and for the last bloody time, John, I’m not your housekeeper."
THERAPIST, I’m so sorry. I answered your phone. You were busy. I think you’ll want to take it.
JOHN, Yeah. Who’s this?
SHERLOCK," Get me a fresh glass of water, please. This one’s filthy."
SMITH," I mean, I’m aware of this morning’s developments."
JOHN," Well, he couldn’t have given you this one. It’s ..."
MAN STANDING OUTSIDE, When you’re ready.
JOHN, When did Sherlock give you this address?
SMITH, Two weeks ago.
SMITH, Yes. Two weeks.
JOHN, How did you know where to find me?
MRS HUDSON," Oh, Sherlock told me. He’s not so difficult when you’ve got a gun on him."
JOHN," Wednesday morning I booked today’s session. Now, today is Friday. So two weeks ago – two weeks before you were abducted at gunpoint and brought here against your will ..."
MRS HUDSON, How?
SHERLOCK, Because Mrs Hudson’s right. I’m burning up.
SHERLOCK, I’m at the bottom of a pit and I’m still falling and ... (he shakes his head and clenches his eyes closed) ... I’m never climbing out.
JOHN, So what has all this got to do with me?
SHERLOCK," Look at me. Can’t do it, not now. Not alone."
JOHN, You lie all the time. It’s like your mission.
SHERLOCK," Well, you’re a doctor. Examine me. (He sits down on the chair again.)"
JOHN," No, I need a second opinion."
JOHN, I need the one person who – unlike me – learned to see through your bullshit long ago.
SHERLOCK," Who’s that, then? I’m sure I would have noticed."
JOHN, The last person you’d think of.
JOHN, I want you to be examined by Molly Hooper.
JOHN, D’you hear me? I said Molly Hooper.
JOHN, Like what?
MOLLY," Um, hel-hello. Is, uh ... I’m sorry, Sh-Sherlock asked me to come."
JOHN," What, two weeks ago?"
MOLLY, Yeah. About two weeks.
SHERLOCK, If you’d like to know how I predict the future ...
MOLLY," Oh, well ..."
SHERLOCK, Just tell me when to cough.
SHERLOCK, Hope you remembered my coat.
MOLLY, Wh...
MOLLY, I... Sorry. I didn’t know that you were gonna be here.
JOHN, Sherlock’s using again.
MOLLY," Oh God. But, um, a-are you sure?"
JOHN, No. It’s Sherlock. Of course I’m not sure. (He glares towards the ambulance then speaks more quietly to Molly.) Just check him out.
JOHN," Mrs Hudson. As ever, you are amazing."
MRS HUDSON," You know that, don’t you? The game is on!"
MRS HUDSON," Anything you need, any time, just ask. Anything at all!"
JOHN, Thank you.
JOHN," Sometimes, can I borrow your car?"
MRS HUDSON, No.
JOHN, Okay.
MARY, He knew you’d get a new therapist after I died because you’d need to change everything. That’s just what you’re like.
JOHN, Thanks.
MARY," You keep your weekends for Rosie, so you needed to see someone during working hours."
MARY," Because you’re an idiot, you don’t want anyone at the surgery knowing you’re in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions with someone reasonably close."
MARY, Who isn’t?!
MARY, So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.
MARY," My God, he knows you."
JOHN, No he doesn’t.
DRIVER," You ready, sir?"
JOHN," Yes, I am."
MARY," Yeah, okay, all right, he is. (She mock-shudders.) Urgh!"
 text reads, 
Along the bottom of the poster it reads, 
SMITH, You know I’m a killer.
SMITH, But did you know I’m a s... 
SMITH," Oh, was that me? Er, was I too good, huh?"
CORNELIA, He’s here.
SHERLOCK, Basically fine.
MOLLY, I’ve seen healthier people on the slab.
SHERLOCK," Yeah but, to be fair, you work with murder victims. They tend to be quite young."
MOLLY, Not funny.
SHERLOCK, Little bit funny.
SHERLOCK," Exactly, weeks. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves."
MOLLY, I’m stressed; you’re dying.
SHERLOCK," Yeah, well, I’m ahead, then. Stress can ruin every day of your life."
SHERLOCK, Dying can only ruin one.
SHERLOCK, When have I ever been that?
JOHN, Since the day I met you.
SHERLOCK," Oh, clever boy. I’ve missed you fumbling ’round the place."
SHERLOCK, What?
SHERLOCK, ’Course it’s not a trick. It’s a plan.
 Thirty feet and closing, the most significant undetected serial killer in British criminal history.
JOHN, What ... what plan?
SHERLOCK, I’m not telling you.
JOHN, Why not?
SHERLOCK, Because you won’t like it.
SMITH, Mr Holmes!
SMITH, I don’t do handshakes. (He starts to walk towards Sherlock again.) It’ll have to be a hug.
SHERLOCK, I know.
SMITH," Oh, Sherlock."
SMITH," Oh, Sherlock! (Releasing him, he steps back.) What can I say? Thanks to you ... (he turns to his entourage) ... we’re, uh, we’re everywhere!"
MALE REPORTER," Mr Holmes, how did Culverton talk you into this?"
SMITH," Well, he-he’s a detective. (He fakes a startled look.) Maybe I just confessed!"
SMITH, Come on.
MALE REPORTER," Mr Holmes, can you put on the hat?"
JOHN," Yeah, he doesn’t really wear the hat."
SMITH, Kids will be getting two of their five-a-day before they’ve even left home!
CORNELIA, Sherlock’s been amazing for us.
SMITH, And you know what makes it cool when you’re a kid?
SMITH, Dangerous.
SMITH, I’m a killer.
SMITH, You know I’m a killer.
SMITH, But did you know ...
SMITH, ... I’m a cereal killer?!
SMITH," We should bag that up, sell it. (He spits a last bit of cereal into the bin.) Make money for that on eBay."
JOHN, Has it occurred to you – anywhere in your drug-addled brain – that you’ve just been played?
SHERLOCK," Oh, yes."
JOHN, For an ad campaign.
SHERLOCK," Brilliant, isn’t it?"
JOHN, Brilliant?
SHERLOCK, Safest place to hide.
SHERLOCK, Plain sight.
JOHN, Hospital?
CORNELIA, Culverton’s doing a visit. The kids would love to meet you both. I think he sort of promised.
SHERLOCK," Oh, okay."
CORNELIA, If you’d just like to come this way.
SMITH," What do you think, Mr Holmes? ‘Cereal’ killer."
SMITH, See you at the hospital.
SMITH, Have what back?
SHERLOCK," Oh, I sent and deleted a text. You might get a reply but I doubt it."
SMITH, It’s password protected.
SMITH," We’re going to have endless fun, Mr Holmes, aren’t we?"
SHERLOCK," Oh no. No, not endless."
JOHN," Need another hit, do you?"
SHERLOCK, I can wait until the hospital.
NURSE CORNISH, You involved much?
JOHN, Sorry?
NURSE CORNISH," Um, with Mr Holmes – Sherlock and all his cases?"
JOHN," Uh, yeah. I’m John Watson."
JOHN, Doctor Watson.
NURSE CORNISH," I love his blog, don’t you?"
JOHN, His blog?
NURSE CORNISH," Oh, don’t you read it?"
JOHN, You mean my blog.
SHERLOCK, Say what you like about addiction; the day is full of highlights.
SHERLOCK, Psychedelic!
NURSE CORNISH, I was just saying I love your blog.
SHERLOCK, Great. I ...
SHERLOCK, It is. He writes the blog.
JOHN, Yes.
NURSE CORNISH, You write Sherlock’s blog?
JOHN, Yes.
NURSE CORNISH," It’s ... gone downhill a little bit, hasn’t it?"
NURSE," Oh, my God; I love your blog! "
SHERLOCK, You’re welcome!
SMITH, You all know Sherlock Holmes!
SHERLOCK, Hello!
SMITH," Oh, and Doctor Watson, of course."
SMITH," Mr Holmes. I was wondering – well ... (he turns to the kids) ... we all were, weren’t we? – maybe you could tell us about some of your cases."
JOHN, Yes.
SHERLOCK," Yes! Absolutely, yes. "
SHERLOCK," The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself, but rather the iron chain of reasoning, from cause to effect, that reveals – step by step – the solution. That’s the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair. Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me, and in this very room you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington the Poisoner."
JOHN, I think you slightly gave away the ending.
JOHN, One of them called Blessington.
JOHN, Poison?
SHERLOCK, Okay.
SHERLOCK," Drearcliff House. Remember that one, John?"
SHERLOCK," One murder, ten suspects. (He excitedly holds up his hands and splays his fingers.)"
JOHN," Ten, yeah."
SHERLOCK, All of them guilty.
JOHN, Sherlock ...
SHERLOCK," Uh, wh-wh-wh-what did you call that one, John? Um, something to do with murder at the zoo."
JOHN," Yeah, I called it Murder at the Zoo."
SHERLOCK, Or-or was it The Case of the Killer Orang-Utan?
MARY, He should be wearing the hat. The kids’d love the hat.
ONE OF THE KIDS, I don’t think so.
SHERLOCK, No?
SMITH, Mr Holmes?
SHERLOCK," Good, then I’ll ... (He trails off and turns to Smith.)"
SMITH, How do you catch a serial killer?
SHERLOCK, Same way you catch any other killer.
SMITH," No, but m-most killers kill someone they know."
SMITH, You’re looking for a murderer in a tiny social grouping.
NURSE CORNISH," Um, Mr Smith. Um, I’m-I’m just, er, wondering. Maybe this isn’t a suitable subject for the children."
NURSE CORNISH, Seven years.
SMITH, Seven years.
SMITH, Okay.
SMITH, Serial killers choose their victims at random. Surely that must make it more difficult?
SMITH, Do they really?
SHERLOCK," Ultimately, for full satisfaction, it requires ... (he speaks the next two words pedantically) ... plain sight. Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled. They tend to be social outcasts, educationally sub-normal."
SMITH," No-no-no-no-no-no. You’re just talking about the ones you know, the ones you’ve caught."
SMITH," But hello, dummy, you only catch the dumb ones. Now, imagine if the Queen wanted to kill some people. What would happen then?"
SMITH," All that power, all that money. (He squeezes the head of the doll with one thumb, crushing its face.) Sweet little government dancing attendance."
SMITH, A whole country just to keep her warm and ... 
SMITH, ... and fat.
SMITH, Hm.
SMITH," We all love the Queen, don’t we? And I bet she’d love you lot!"
JOHN," Uh, it-it’s all right, everyone. I can personally assure you that Sherlock Holmes is not about to arrest the Queen. (He grins at the kids.)"
SMITH," Well, of course not! Not Her Majesty!"
SMITH," Money, power, fame."
SMITH, Some things make you untouchable.
JOHN, No-one’s untouchable.
SMITH, No-one?
SMITH, Look at you all! So gloomy! Can’t you take a joke?
SMITH," The Queen! If the Queen was a serial killer, I’d be the first person she’d tell! (He pulls a funny face.) We have that kind of friendship!"
SMITH, A big round of applause for Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson!
SMITH, Come on! Wonderful!
SMITH, Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.
SHERLOCK, Where are we going now?
SMITH, I want to show you my favourite room.
SHERLOCK," No, let’s go in here."
SHERLOCK, So you’ve had another one of your little meetings.
SMITH," Oh, it’s just a monthly top-up. Confession is good for the soul ... providing you can delete it."
JOHN, What’s TD12?
SHERLOCK, It’s a memory inhibitor.
SMITH, Bliss.
JOHN, Bliss? 
SMITH, Opt-in ignorance. Makes the world go round.
SMITH," Some people take the drip out, yeah. Some people have the same ... urges. Huh ... (he claps his hands together) ... come on. Wasting time."
SHERLOCK, Indeed. (He looks at his watch.) You have – I estimate – twenty minutes left.
SMITH, Sorry?
SHERLOCK," I sent a text from your phone, remember? It was read almost immediately. Factoring in a degree of shock, an emotional decision and a journey time based on the associated address, I’d say that your life as you know it has twenty minutes left to run."
SHERLOCK," Well, no, seventeen and a half, to be precise but I rounded up for dramatic effect, so please do show us your favourite room. (He walks closer to Smith, glaring at him intensely.) It’ll give you a chance to say ... goodbye."
SMITH, Come along.
MARY, Do you still miss me?
SMITH," Speaking of serial killers, you know who’s my favourite?"
SHERLOCK, Other than yourself?
SMITH, H. H. Holmes.
SMITH, Relative of yours?
SHERLOCK, Not as far as I know.
SMITH, You should check. What an idiot.
SMITH, Everyone out.
SAHEED," Mr Smith, we’re actually in the middle of something."
SAHEED," Saheed, yes."
SMITH, How long have you been working here now?
SAHEED, Four years.
SAHEED," Okay, everyone."
SAHEED, Five minutes?
SMITH, Come back in ten.
SMITH, Saheed.
SMITH," This time, knock."
JOHN," How can you do that? I mean, how-how are you even allowed in here?"
SMITH," Oh, I-I can go anywhere I like."
SMITH, They presented ’em to me. There was a ceremony. You can watch that on YouTube.
SMITH, Home Secretary was there.
 your favourite room, the mortuary.
SMITH, What d’you think?
SHERLOCK, Tough crowd.
SMITH," Oh, I don’t know."
SMITH," No, I’ve always found ’em quite pliable."
JOHN, Don’t do that.
SMITH, H. H. Holmes loved the dead. He mass-produced ’em.
SMITH, ... without the pies!
SMITH, Stupid. So stupid.
JOHN, Why stupid?
SMITH," Well, all that effort. You don’t build a beach if you want to hide a pebble; you just find a beach!"
SMITH," And if you wanna hide a murder, or wanna hide lots and lots of murders, just find a ... "
SMITH, ... hospital.
JOHN, Can we be clear? Are you confessing?
SMITH, To what?
JOHN, The way you’re talking ... (He stops.)
SMITH, I do like to mess with people ...
SMITH," ... and yes, I am a bit creepy, but that’s just my U.S.P."
SMITH, I use it to sell breakfast cereal. But am I what he says I am? (He points at Sherlock.) Is that what you’re asking?
JOHN, Yes.
SMITH," Hm. Well, let me ask you this. (He stops and turns to look at John.) Are you really a doctor?"
JOHN," Yeah, of course I am."
SMITH," Well, no, a medical doctor, you know. Not just feet, or media studies or something."
JOHN, I’m a doctor.
SMITH," Are you serious? No, really, are you?"
SMITH, Are you ... are you actually serious?
SMITH, I’ve played along with this joke. It’s not funny any more. No ... look at him.
SMITH," Go ahead, look at him, Doctor Watson! Hm? Oh, no, I’ll lay it out for you."
SHERLOCK, Nineteen and a half minutes.
SHERLOCK, Your daughter Faith’s walking cane.
SMITH, And why would she be here?
SHERLOCK, You invited her. (He smiles tightly at him.) You sent her a text – or-or-or technically I sent her a text but she’s not to know.
SHERLOCK," Ah, let’s see if I can recall."
SHERLOCK," “Faith... I can stand it no longer, I’ve confessed... to my crimes. Please forgive me!”"
SMITH, Why would that have any effect? (He smiles.) You don’t know her.
SHERLOCK," Oh, but I do. (He smiles.) I spent a whole evening with her. (He grins.) We had chips."
SHERLOCK, I think she liked me.
SMITH, You don’t know Faith. You simply do not. (He smiles.)
SHERLOCK, I know you care about her deeply. I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings. (He steps closer to Smith.) You care what she thinks.
SHERLOCK, You maintain an impressive façade.
SHERLOCK, I think it’s about to break.
LESTRADE, Did you know?
SMITH, No she didn’t.
JOHN, Of course I didn’t.
SMITH, Never happened. Is this another one of your drug-fuelled fantasies?
LESTRADE, You didn’t see him take the scalpel?
JOHN, Nobody saw him. 
LESTRADE, So you didn’t know what was about to happen.
JOHN, Of course I didn’t know.
SHERLOCK," Faith, stop loitering at the door and come in! This is your father’s favourite room."
SHERLOCK, Come and meet his best friends.
FAITH, What’s happening? What was that text?
FAITH, Are you having one of your jokes?
FAITH, Who are you?
 and various details appear around her, 
Hair, Mid-Blonde
Height, 5’5”
Dress Size, 10
Skin, Fair
Posture, Favours Right
SHERLOCK, Who the hell are you?
FAITH, Oh my God!
SMITH, Mm!
FAITH, Sherlock Holmes! (She looks at Sherlock.) I love your blog.
SHERLOCK, You’re not her. You’re not the woman who came to Baker Street.
FAITH," Um, well, no. Never been there."
LESTRADE," Well, there must have been some build-up. He didn’t just suddenly do it."
FAITH, U-understand what?
JOHN, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK, So who came to my flat?
FAITH," Well, it wasn’t me."
SMITH," Oh, no!"
FAITH, I wasn’t there.
SMITH," Oh, dear!"
WIGGINS, Who you talkin’ to?
MRS HUDSON, What friend?
FAITH, Anyone.
SMITH, Oh no!
JOHN, Sherlock.
JOHN," Sherlock? Are you all right? Sherlock, are you okay?"
SHERLOCK, Watch him. He’s got a knife.
SHERLOCK, I saw you take it.
SMITH, I certainly did not!
FAITH, Oh my God.
JOHN," He’s not laughing, Sherlock."
JOHN, Sherlock!
LESTRADE," Ohh, Christ!"
LESTRADE, I keep wondering if we should have seen it coming.
JOHN," Not long ago, he shot Charles Magnussen in the face. We did see it coming."
JOHN, We always saw it coming. But it was fun.
LESTRADE, Come in.
POLICE OFFICER, Sir. You probably want to see this.
SMITH, I’m a fan of Sherlock Holmes. I’m a big fan.
JOHN, Sherlock! 
SMITH," It’s not actually my hospital ... Well, it is a little bit my hospital ... (he smiles at the reporter) ... Uh, but I can promise you this: he’s going to get the best of care. I might even move him to my favourite room."
JOHN, Wake up!
JOHN, Hit him hard.
JOHN, A bloody game?
SMITH," Thank you, Doctor Watson."
SMITH, But I don’t think he’s a danger any more.
SMITH, Leave him be.
NURSE CORNISH," Oh, hi."
JOHN, No. I’m just in to say goodbye.
NURSE CORNISH, I’m sure he’ll pull through.
NURSE CORNISH," And yeah, he’s made a terrible mess of himself, but he’s awfully strong, so must look on the bright side."
JOHN, Well ...
JOHN, Parting gift.
NURSE CORNISH," Oh, that’s nice. A walking stick."
JOHN," Yeah, it was mine from ... a long time ago."
NURSE CORNISH, Hello? Ward seventy-three.
NURSE CORNISH," Oh, uh, Doctor Watson?"
JOHN, Hm?
NURSE CORNISH, It’s for you.
JOHN," Hello, Mycroft."
MARY, No! You are.
MARY," Well, seeing as I’m inside your head, I think we can call that self-loathing."
MYCROFT, Where is she?
MYCROFT, Where’s Mrs Hudson?
AGENT, She’ll be up in a moment.
MYCROFT, Have you noticed the kitchen? (He stands up as John looks around the living room before turning towards the kitchen.) It’s practically a meth lab. I’m trying to establish exactly what drove Sherlock off the rails.
MYCROFT, Any ideas?
JOHN, Hang on – are they tidying?
MYCROFT, Sherlock is a security concern. The fact that I’m his brother changes nothing.
MARY, Ask him.
MYCROFT, Spending all night talking to a woman who wasn’t even there.
MARY," Oh, shut up, you."
MYCROFT," No-no-no-no, stop. (He raises a disparaging hand and turns and walks a few steps towards Sherlock’s chair.) I detest conversation in the past tense."
MYCROFT, It doesn’t.
JOHN," You said it didn’t the last time and it wouldn’t with Sherlock, so who was it the last time? Who were you talking about?"
MARY, Attaboy.
MYCROFT, Nobody. I ... misspoke.
MYCROFT, I assure you I’m not.
MARY, He really is lying.
JOHN," Sherlock’s not your only brother. There’s another one, isn’t there?"
MRS HUDSON, Mycroft Holmes!
MRS HUDSON, What are all these dreadful people doing in my house?
MRS HUDSON, And that’s what you’re all looking for?
MYCROFT, Quite so.
MRS HUDSON, What’s on his mind?
MYCROFT, So to speak.
MRS HUDSON, And you’ve had all this time?
MYCROFT, Time being something of which we don’t have an infinite supply ... (he includes John in his gaze) ... so if we could be about our business?
MRS HUDSON, You are ... 
MRS HUDSON," ... you’re-you’re so funny, you are!"
MYCROFT, Mrs Hudson?
MRS HUDSON," I mean, he knows you’re an idiot, but that’s okay ’cause you’re a lovely doctor ..."
MRS HUDSON, ... but he has no idea what an idiot you are!
MYCROFT," I know his thought processes better than any other human being, so please try to understand ..."
MYCROFT, Of course he is.
MRS HUDSON," No, no. He’s more ... emotional, isn’t he?"
MRS HUDSON, Unsolved case: shoot the wall.
MRS HUDSON, Pew! Pew!
MRS HUDSON, Unmade breakfast: karate the fridge!
MRS HUDSON, Unanswered question ...
MRS HUDSON," Well, what does he do with anything he can’t answer, John, every time?"
JOHN, He stabs it.
MRS HUDSON, Anything he can’t find the answer for: ... (she points two fingers towards the mantelpiece) ... bang! ...
MRS HUDSON," ... it’s up there. I keep telling him: if he was any good as a detective, I wouldn’t need a new mantel."
JOHN," Okay, no. S-stop that now, please."
MRS HUDSON," Everybody out, now. All of you."
MARY, When I’m ... gone – if I’m gone – I need you to do something for me. Save John Watson.
MARY," Save him, Sherlock."
MRS HUDSON," John, if you want to watch this later ..."
MARY," Don’t think anyone else is going to save him, because there isn’t anyone. It’s up to you. Save him. But I do think you’re gonna need a little bit of help with that, because you’re not exactly good with people, so here’s a few things you need to know about the man we both love – and more importantly what you’re going to need to do to save him."
SMITH," Policeman outside, you mean? Come on. Can’t you guess?"
SHERLOCK, H. H. Holmes.
SMITH," Murder castle, but done right. I have a question for you. Why are you here? It’s like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me."
SMITH, Why?
SMITH," I’d like to hear you say it. (He smiles briefly.) Say it for me, please."
SHERLOCK, I want you to kill me.
MRS HUDSON, John!
MRS HUDSON, My car.
SHERLOCK, ... toxic shock should shut me down within about an hour.
SHERLOCK, Yes.
SMITH, You’re rather good at this.
SMITH, Before we start ... (he drops his jacket onto the chair near the drip stand) ... tell me how you feel.
SMITH, Be more specific. (He chuckles.) You only get to do this the once.
SHERLOCK, I’m ... scared of dying.
SMITH," You wanted this, though. (He starts to roll up his shirtsleeves.)"
SHERLOCK, I have ... reasons.
SMITH, But you don’t actually want to die.
SHERLOCK, No.
SMITH," Good. (Still smiling, he continues rolling up his sleeves.) Say that for me. Say it."
SMITH, Here it comes.
s the thing," he never refuses it. So, here’s what you are going to do."
SMITH, So tell me: why are we doing this? To what do I owe the pleasure?
SMITH, But why do you need to die?
SHERLOCK, The mortuary; your favourite room.
SHERLOCK, You talk to the dead. You make your confession to them.
POLICE OFFICER," Sorry, sir, what?"
POLICE OFFICER, What do you mean?
NURSE CORNISH," Oh, has that door locked itself again? Yeah, it’s always doing that."
SMITH, ... it just makes me ... (he lets out a long contented sigh) ... incredibly happy.
SMITH, You know what? I’m getting a little impatient.
SMITH," ... but if-if you’re rich or famous and loved, it’s amazing what people are prepared to ignore."
SMITH," There’s always someone desperate, about to go missing ..."
SMITH, ... and no-one wants to suspect murder if it’s easier to suspect something else!
SMITH, I just have to ration myself; choose the right heart to stop.
POLICE OFFICER, Mr Holmes! You okay?
JOHN, What were you doing to him?
SMITH, He’s in distress! I-I’m helping him!
JOHN," Restrain him, now. Do it."
SMITH, I was trying to help him!
JOHN," Sherlock, what was he doing to you?"
JOHN, On what?
SHERLOCK, Saline.
SHERLOCK," Yeah, saline."
JOHN," What d’you mean, saline?"
SHERLOCK," Well obviously I got Nurse Cornish to switch the bags. She’s a big fan, you know? Loves my blog."
JOHN, You’re okay?
SHERLOCK," I got my confession, though, didn’t I?"
SMITH, Huh! I don’t recall making any confession.
JOHN," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
SHERLOCK, You can listen to it later.
SMITH, But there is no confession to listen to!
SMITH," Oh, Mr Holmes. I-I don’t know if this is relevant, but we found three potential recording devices in the pockets of your coat."
SMITH," Um, all your possessions were searched. (He looks at John.) Sorry."
JOHN, What? What is it? What?
JOHN, You cock.
SHERLOCK, Yeah.
JOHN," Utter, utter cock."
SHERLOCK, Heard you the first time.
JOHN, So how-how does it open?
SHERLOCK, Screw the top.
JOHN, Two weeks ago?
SHERLOCK, Three.
JOHN, I’m that predictable?
SHERLOCK, I’m just a cock.
SMITH, I sh-should have done it sooner.
LESTRADE, We’ll carry on tomorrow. (He reaches for his jacket on the back of his chair.)
SMITH," Well, w-w-we could carry on now. I’m-I’m not tired. There’s loads more."
SMITH," You know, I am gonna be so famous now."
SMITH," Yeah, but with this ..."
SMITH, ... I can break America.
SHERLOCK," And, of course, I hadn’t really anticipated that I’d hallucinated meeting his daughter."
MARY," ... so that you’d have something to do, something doctory. You get that now, though?"
JOHN, But she wasn’t ever here?
SHERLOCK," Interesting, isn’t it? I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to every available data stream in the world simultaneously, it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything."
MARY," Well, it sounds about right to me. (She looks up thoughtfully.) Possibly I’m biased. (She smiles down at John.)"
SHERLOCK," Perhaps the drugs opened certain doors in my mind. (He looks away again, thinking about it.) I’m intrigued. (He takes another drink from his mug.)"
JOHN," Oh, I know you are ... "
JOHN, ... which is why we’re all taking it in turns to keep you off the sweeties.
JOHN, Molly’ll be here in twenty minutes.
SHERLOCK," Oh, I do think I can last twenty minutes without supervision."
JOHN," Well, if you’re sure."
JOHN," Uh, sorry, it’s just, um, you know, Rosie."
SHERLOCK," Yes, of course, Rosie."
MARY, Go and solve a crime together. Make him wear the hat!
SHERLOCK," Yes. Yes! Sorry, I-I wasn’t thinking of Rosie."
MARY," Actually, he should wear the hat as a special tribute to me. I’m dead. I would really appreciate it."
SHERLOCK," Oh, by the way, the recordings will probably be inadmissible."
JOHN," Sorry, what?"
SHERLOCK," Well, technically, it’s entrapment so it might get thrown out as evidence. Not that that matters; apparently he can’t stop confessing. (He chuckles.)"
JOHN, That’s good.
SHERLOCK, Yeah.
SHERLOCK, Are you okay?
JOHN," Uh, what, am I ... no, no, I’m not okay. I’m never gonna be okay."
JOHN, ... but we’ll just have to accept that. It is what it is; and what it is is ... shit.
MARY," John, do better."
JOHN, You didn’t kill Mary.
JOHN, Mary died saving your life. It was her choice. No-one made her do it. No-one could ever make her do anything ...
JOHN, ... but the point is: you did not kill her.
JOHN, It is what it is. 
MARY, That noise: that’s a text alert noise.
SHERLOCK, Mm? (He swallows his mouthful.) What was what?
MARY," That’s the text alert of Irene Adler. She’s the scary mad one, right?"
MARY," But she’s dead. (She sucks in a long gasp and looks at John.) Ooh, I bet she isn’t dead!"
MARY, I bet he saved her! (Laughing) Oh my God!
MARY," Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix! (Raising her eyes to John as she speaks) He’s never knowingly under-clichéd, is he?"
SHERLOCK, John?
JOHN, I’m gonna make a deduction.
SHERLOCK," Oh, okay. That’s good."
JOHN," And if my deduction is right, you’re gonna be honest and tell me, okay?"
SHERLOCK, Okay. Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert to become randomly attached to a ...
SHERLOCK," Thank you, John. That’s ... very kind of you. (He looks down to his mug.)"
JOHN, Never knew when your birthday was.
JOHN," Seriously, we’re not gonna talk about this?"
JOHN," I mean, how does it work?"
JOHN, D’you go to a discreet Harvester sometimes? Is there a ... night of passion in High Wycombe?
s note, Harvester is a restaurant chain in the UK. (Sherlock and Irene do not go and sit on a tractor in the middle of nowhere.) High Wycombe is a town in Buckinghamshire.]
SHERLOCK," Oh, for God’s sakes. I don’t text her back."
JOHN, You bloody moron!
JOHN, ... and do you have the first idea how lucky you are?
JOHN," Yes, she’s a lunatic, she’s a criminal, she’s insanely dangerous – trust you to fall for a sociopath ..."
JOHN," ... but she’s ... you know ... (He stops, unable to find the words.)"
SHERLOCK, What?
JOHN, Just text her back.
SHERLOCK, Why?
JOHN, Because High Wycombe is better than you are currently equipped to understand.
SHERLOCK, I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe.
SHERLOCK, That doesn’t even mean anything.
 Sherlock," it’s gone before you know it. (Firmly, emphasising each word) Before you know it."
JOHN, She was wrong about me.
SHERLOCK, Mary? How so?
JOHN, She thought that if you put yourself in harm’s way I’d ... I’d rescue you or something. But I didn’t – not ’til she told me to. (He briefly glances towards Mary as he says ‘she.’) And that’s how this works. That’s what you’re missing. (He points towards Mary.) She taught me to be the man she already thought I was. Get yourself a piece of that.
SHERLOCK," Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice. I have known many people in this world but made few friends, and I can safely say ..."
JOHN, I cheated on her.
JOHN, No clever comeback?
JOHN," I cheated on you, Mary."
JOHN," There was a woman on the bus, and I had a plastic daisy in my hair. I’d been playing with Rosie. (He pauses for a moment then raises his eyes.) And this girl just smiled at me."
JOHN, That’s all it was; it was a smile.
JOHN," That’s all it was, just texting."
JOHN, But I wanted more.
JOHN," And d’you know something? I still do. I’m not the man you thought I was; I’m not that guy. I never could be. But that’s the point. (He sniffs, then looks at her as his eyes fill with more tears. He bites his lip and speaks tearfully.) That’s the whole point."
JOHN, Who you thought I was ... (she nods at him) ... is the man who I want to be.
MARY, Get the hell on with it.
SHERLOCK," Oh, well. Suppose a sugar high’s some sort of substitute."
JOHN, Behave.
SHERLOCK, Right then. You know ...
SHERLOCK, ... it’s not my place to say but ... it was just texting.
SHERLOCK, People text.
SHERLOCK," Even I text. Her, I mean. Woman. Bad idea; try not to, but, you know, sometimes."
SHERLOCK," It’s not a pleasant thought, John, but I have this terrible feeling, from time to time, that we might all just be human."
JOHN, Even you?
SHERLOCK, No.
SHERLOCK, Even you.
JOHN, Cake?
SHERLOCK," Oh, um ..."
JOHN, What? What is it?
JOHN, What’s wrong?
JOHN, Seriously?!
SHERLOCK, I’m Sherlock Holmes. I wear the damn hat.
 inserted here so as not to interrupt later scenes," a person’s name will be given during a later conversation. It’s an unusual name and there has been much discussion online about how it is spelled, because historically there are two variants. I have chosen to go with the version that seems most likely to be correct, even though it’s pronounced slightly differently, but this spelling was used in the BBC subtitles and was therefore probably given to the subtitler by the producers. If the next episode or the writers/producers specifically clarify that they choose to spell it the other way, I’ll correct the transcript.]"
THERAPIST, It is what it is?
JOHN, Yeah.
THERAPIST, And Rosie?
JOHN," Oh, beautiful, perfect, unprecedented in the history of children. (He smiles.) That’s not my bias; that’s scientific fact. (He nods.)"
THERAPIST, Good.
THERAPIST, And Sherlock Holmes?
JOHN, Back to normal.
MALE CLIENT, She’s possessed by the Devil!
MALE CLIENT, I swear my wife is channeling Satan!
SHERLOCK," Why not, given your immediate alternative?"
JOHN, Mycroft? He’s fine.
MYCROFT," So, you’re off now?"
MYCROFT, I won’t see you for a week?
MYCROFT, The P.M.
LADY SMALLWOOD, My number.
MYCROFT, I already have your number.
LADY SMALLWOOD, My private number.
MYCROFT, Why would I need that?
LADY SMALLWOOD, Up to you. (She smiles at him.) Call me.
SHERLOCK, She was real.
THERAPIST, I meant the other one.
JOHN, Wh-which other one?
THERAPIST, You know – the secret one.
JOHN," Oh, that was just something I ... (he smiles and takes a breath) ... I said. I’m sure there’s ..."
JOHN, How did you know about that? I didn’t tell you that.
THERAPIST, You must have done.
JOHN, I really didn’t.
THERAPIST," Well, maybe Sherlock told me."
THERAPIST," Oh, no, no. I-I-I met him before that."
JOHN, When?
THERAPIST, It was lovely. We had chips.
THERAPIST, Culverton gave me Faith’s original note. (She stands up.) A mutual friend put us in touch.
THERAPIST, Did Sherlock ever tell you about the note?
THERAPIST," I added some deductions for Sherlock. (She puts the door key onto the side table, then drops her glasses onto the table.) He was ... quite good."
THERAPIST, ... he didn’t get the big one.
THERAPIST," In fairness, though, he does have excellent taste in chips."
JOHN, What’s that?
THERAPIST, What’s what?
JOHN, The flower in your hair: it’s like I had on the bus.
THERAPIST, ... you have such nice eyes.
THERAPIST," Oh, please don’t go anywhere. I’m sure the therapist who actually lives here wouldn’t want blood on the carpet. "
THERAPIST," Oh, hang on, it’s fine. She’s in a sack in the airing cupboard."
JOHN, Who are you?
EURUS," Silly name, isn’t it? Greek. Means the East Wind."
EURUS," My parents loved silly names, like Eurus ... or Mycroft ... or Sherlock."
EURUS," Oh, look at him. Didn’t it ever occur to you – not even once – that Sherlock’s secret brother might just be Sherlock’s secret sister?"
EURUS, Huh. He’s making a funny face.
EURUS, I think I’ll put a hole in it.
GIRL, Mummy?
GIRL, Mummy! Wake up! Wake up! Mummy!
GIRL, Wake up!
VOICE, Hello. My name’s Jim Moriarty. Welcome ... to the final problem.
LEONARD, You know I could arrest you?
VELMA, What for?
LEONARD, Wearing a dress like that.
VELMA, Would you like me to take it off?
LEONARD, Then I’d really have to press charges.
VELMA, Press away.
VELMA," Now, what was all that about arresting me?"
VELMA, Very close?
LEONARD, You were?
VELMA, Fingerprinting ...
VELMA, ... thoroughly.
VOICE, Mycroft.
VOICE, Mycroft.
MYCROFT, Why don’t you come out and show yourself? I don’t have time for this.
s VOICE," We have time, brother dear. All the time in the world."
MYCROFT, Who are you?
MYCROFT, Impossible.
s VOICE, You of all people know that.
s VOICE, There’s no defence ... (the voice becomes more of a whisper) ... and nowhere to hide.
MYCROFT, Sherlock? Help me!
SHERLOCK, Experiment complete. Conclusion: I have a sister.
SHERLOCK," Conclusion two: my sister – Eurus, apparently – has been incarcerated from an early age in a secure institution controlled by my brother."
SHERLOCK," Hey, bro!"
SHERLOCK, Conclusion three: you are terrified of her!
 New information, she’s out.
MYCROFT, That’s not possible.
SHERLOCK, It’s more than possible. She was John’s therapist.
JOHN, Shot me during a session.
SHERLOCK, Only with a tranquilliser.
JOHN, Mm. We still had ten minutes to go.
SHERLOCK," Well, we’ll see about a refund."
SHERLOCK," Right, you two. Wiggins has got your money by the gate."
SHERLOCK, Don’t spend it all in one crack den.
SHERLOCK," Oh, I hope we didn’t spoil your enjoyment of the movie."
MYCROFT, You’re just leaving?
SHERLOCK," Well, we’re not staying here. Eurus is coming and, uh, someone’s disabled all your security."
SHERLOCK, Sleep well!
MYCROFT, Doctor Watson. Why would he do that to me? That was insane!
JOHN," Uh, yes. Well, someone convinced him that you wouldn’t tell the truth unless you were actually wetting yourself."
MYCROFT, “Someone”?
JOHN, Probably me.
MYCROFT," So that’s it, is it? You’re just going?"
JOHN, Two two one B Baker Street.
JOHN, You might wanna close that window. (He looks at Mycroft.) There is an East Wind coming.
MRS HUDSON, You have to sit in the chair.
MRS HUDSON, They won’t talk to you unless you sit in the chair. It’s the rules.
MYCROFT," She’s not going to stay there, is she?"
MYCROFT, Thank you.
SHERLOCK," You’re going to tell the truth, Mycroft, pure and simple."
MYCROFT," Who was it said, “Truth is rarely pure, and never simple”?"
SHERLOCK," A sister I can’t remember. Interesting name, Eurus. It’s Greek, isn’t it?"
MYCROFT, Yes.
MYCROFT, No.
SHERLOCK, You turned my sister into a ghost story.
MYCROFT, Of course I didn’t. I monitored you.
JOHN, You what?
MYCROFT, This is a private matter.
SHERLOCK, John stays.
JOHN, So there were three Holmes kids.
JOHN, What was the age gap?
MYCROFT, Seven years between myself and Sherlock; one year between Sherlock and Eurus.
JOHN, Middle child. Explains a lot.
MYCROFT, Have what?
JOHN, The deduction thing.
JOHN, Enlighten me.
SHERLOCK, As you never cease to announce.
MYCROFT," ... but Eurus, she was incandescent even then. Our abilities were professionally assessed more than once. I was remarkable, but Eurus was described as an era-defining genius, beyond Newton."
MYCROFT," You do remember her, in a way. Every choice you ever made; every path you’ve ever taken – the man you are today ... is your memory of Eurus."
MYCROFT, She was different from the beginning.
MYCROFT, She knew things she should never have known ...
EURUS, You look funny grown up.
JOHN, What’s wrong?
MYCROFT, Sorry.
MYCROFT, The memories are disturbing.
SHERLOCK, What do you mean? Examples.
MYCROFT," They found her with a knife once. She seemed to be cutting herself. Mother and Father were terrified. They thought it was a suicide attempt. But when I asked Eurus what she was doing, she said ..."
EURUS, I wanted to see how my muscles worked.
MYCROFT," So I asked her if she felt pain, and she said ..."
EURUS, Which one’s pain?
MYCROFT, Musgrave.
MYCROFT," The ancestral home, where there was always honey for tea."
MYCROFT, ... and Sherlock played among the funny gravestones.
 Carved into the stone are the words, 
s VOICE, ♪ ... who will find me / Deep down below the old beech tree? ♪ 
SHERLOCK, Sixteen by six ...
MYCROFT, You’re starting to remember.
SHERLOCK, Fragments.
YOUNG SHERLOCK, Redbeard!
YOUNG SHERLOCK, Redbeard!
JOHN, Redbeard?
ADULT SHERLOCK, He was my dog.
 We see his pirate hat in close detail for the first time," it’s a very deep blue, almost the same colour as the Coat he will wear in the future, and it has dark red bands sewn down it.)"
MYCROFT, ... and she refused to say where he was.
MYCROFT, She’d only repeat that song; her little ritual.
YOUNG SHERLOCK, Redbeard!
MYCROFT, We begged and begged her to tell us where he was.
MYCROFT, ... but she said ...
MYCROFT, But the song made no sense.
EURUS," ♪ ... brother, and under we go. ♪ "
MYCROFT," We never found him. But she started calling him “Drowned Redbeard,” so we made our assumptions. (To John) Sherlock was traumatised. Natural, I suppose – he was, in the early days, an emotional child; but after that he was different, so changed. Never spoke of it again. In time, he seemed to forget that Eurus had ever even existed."
JOHN, How could he forget? She was living in the same house.
JOHN, Why? You don’t lock up a child because a dog goes missing.
MYCROFT, Quite so. It was what happened immediately afterwards.
MYCROFT," After that, our sister had to be taken away."
SHERLOCK, Where?
MYCROFT," Oh, some suitable place – or so everyone thought. Not suitable enough, however. She died there."
JOHN, How?
MYCROFT," She started another fire, one which she did not survive."
MYCROFT," Yes. It is also a kindness. This is the story I told our parents to spare them further pain, and to account for the absence of an identifiable body."
SHERLOCK, And no doubt to prevent their further interference.
MYCROFT," Well, that too, of course. The depth of Eurus’ psychosis and the extent of her abilities couldn’t hope to be contained in any ordinary institution. Uncle Rudy took care of things."
MYCROFT, There’s a place called Sherrinford; an island. It’s a secure and very secretive installation whose sole purpose is to contain what we call ‘the uncontainables.’
MYCROFT, The demons beneath the road – this is where we trap them. Sherrinford is more than a prison or an asylum; it is a fortress built to keep the rest of the world safe from what is inside it.
MYCROFT," Heaven may be a fantasy for the credulous and the afraid, but I can give you a map reference for Hell."
MYCROFT, That’s where our sister has been since early childhood. She hasn’t left – not for a single day.
MYCROFT," Whoever you both met, it can’t have been her."
VOICE," ♪ I that am lost / Oh, who will find me / Deep down below / The old beech tree? ♪"
VOICE," ♪ Help succour me now / The East Wind’s blowing / Sixteen by six, brother / And under we go. ♪ "
MYCROFT, Keep back! Keep as still as you can!
VOICE, ♪ My soul seeks / The shade of my willow’s bloom ... ♪
SHERLOCK, It’s a drone.
JOHN," Yeah, I can see that."
JOHN, What’s it carrying?
MYCROFT, I’ve authorised the purchase of quite a number of these.
MYCROFT, Colloquially it is known as “the patience grenade.”
JOHN, “Patience”?
MYCROFT," The motion sensor has activated. If any of us move, the grenade will detonate."
SHERLOCK, How powerful?
MYCROFT," It will certainly destroy this flat and kill anyone in it. Assuming walls of reasonable strength, your neighbours should be safe, but as it’s landed on the floor, I am moved to wonder if the café below is open."
SHERLOCK," It’s Sunday morning, so it’s closed."
JOHN, What about Mrs Hudson?
SHERLOCK," Going by her usual routine, I estimate she has another two minutes left."
JOHN, She keeps the vacuum cleaner at the back of the flat.
MYCROFT, So?
JOHN," So, safer there when she’s putting it away?"
JOHN," Look, we have to move eventually. We should do it when she’s safest."
SHERLOCK," When the vacuum stops, we give her eight seconds to get to the back of the flat. She’s fast when she’s cleaning. Then we move."
SHERLOCK, What’s the trigger response time?
SHERLOCK," Once we’re mobile, how long before detonation?"
MYCROFT, We have a maximum of three seconds to vacate the blast radius.
SHERLOCK, John and I will take the windows; you take the stairs. Help get Mrs Hudson out too.
MYCROFT, Me?
SHERLOCK, You’re closer.
MYCROFT, You’re faster.
SHERLOCK, Speed differential won’t be as critical as the distance.
SHERLOCK, I estimate we have a minute left. Is a phone call possible?
MYCROFT, Phone call?
SHERLOCK, John has a daughter. (He glances towards him without moving his head.) He may wish to say goodbye.
MYCROFT," I’m sorry, Doctor Watson. Any movement will set off the grenade."
MYCROFT, I hope you understand.
JOHN, Oscar Wilde.
MYCROFT, What?
JOHN," He said, “The truth is rarely pure, and never simple.” It’s from ‘The Importance of Being Earnest.’ We did it in school."
SHERLOCK, Yeah. You were great.
MYCROFT, You really think so?
SHERLOCK," Yes, I really do."
MYCROFT," Well, that’s good to know. I’ve always wondered."
SHERLOCK," Good luck, boys."
SHERLOCK," Three, two, one, go!"
RADIO," And now the shipping forecast, issued by the Met Office on behalf of the Maritime Coastguard Agency at 05:05. Thames, Dover ..."
VINCE," Go on, son, get it up. (He smiles cheerfully at him.) Better out than in."
BEN, Is it always like this?
VINCE, Nah.
BEN, Thank God.
VINCE, Usually it’s much worse!
BEN, Is that an ’elicopter?
VINCE," Nah, not in this weather."
RADIO," ... Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea, Shannon, Malin, Sherrinford. Sherrinford. Sherrinford."
BEN, You hear that?
RADIO, Sherrinford.
BEN, I never ’eard that one before.
BEN, Sherrinford?
BEN, What?
VINCE," Sometimes when we’re out in these waters, we get that message. Just forget about it."
BEN," Yeah, but we’ve never ..."
VINCE, Just ... 
VINCE, Who the ’ell are you?
SHERLOCK, My name’s Sherlock Holmes.
BEN, The detective!
SHERLOCK, The pirate.
TECHNICIAN," Golf Whiskey X-ray, this is a restricted area, repeat, restricted area. You are off course."
TECHNICIAN," Golf Whiskey X-ray, you are off course. Are you receiving?"
s VOICE," Yeah, receiving you. This is a distress call, repeat, distress call. We’re in trouble here."
TECHNICIAN," Golf Whiskey X-ray, what is your situation?"
TECHNICIAN, Golf Whiskey X-ray? Where are you now?
TECHNICIAN, Governor to the Control Room.
AUTOMATED VOICE, Lockdown in progress. Lockdown in progress.
AUTOMATED VOICE, Please proceed to designated Red stations. Please proceed to designated Red stations. 
BEN," No, hold it! Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
GUARD, Oi! In the sand!
GUARD, In the sand!
SIR EDWIN, He’s not conscious. He’s severely injured. No-one is even confident he’s going to pull through.
SIR EDWIN, Missing.
GOVERNOR," No, he’s not. He’s here."
TECHNICIAN," Sir, we found two more from the boat."
FISHERMAN," He stole our boat! Him an’ another fella, with guns!"
GOVERNOR, Where’d you find them?
GOVERNOR," Holding cell, now."
IRISH GUARD," Right, sir."
AUTOMATED VOICE, Lockdown in progress.
FISHERMAN, This is a mistake. I’m the victim ’ere. (He stands up and jerks a finger down to John.) This man stole my boat. ’e’s a pirate.
JOHN," Yeah, I really am."
GOVERNOR," Please, sit down."
GOVERNOR," He’s Doctor John Watson, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. (He looks down at him.) What are you doing here?"
JOHN, It’s a hospital. Any work?
GOVERNOR, It’s not a hospital.
GOVERNOR," I want eyes on Eurus Holmes. Go straight to the Special Unit, deploy Green and Yellow Shift on my authority."
GOVERNOR," I’m sparing your blushes because we’re supposed to be on the same side; and frankly, this is embarrassing."
GOVERNOR," The true art of disguise, according to your famous friend, is not being looked at."
GOVERNOR," But I am looking at you, aren’t I, Mr Holmes?"
JOHN, But that is sort of the point ... (he looks across to the man beside him) ... isn’t it?
JOHN," See, you should have been looking at the guy you just gave your pass to."
MYCROFT, That’s the trouble with uniforms and name badges. People stop looking at faces. You’d be better off with clown outfits. (He turns around.) At least they’d be satirically relevant.
JOHN," Oh, you’ll find the real Landers on the north shore, tied up with two others."
GOVERNOR, Two others?
JOHN," Mm. Well, it was trial and error. (He gestures to his own waist as he speaks.) We had to find the right waistband."
GOVERNOR, This is insane! This is unnecessary!
JOHN, No; your security is compromised and we don’t know who to trust.
GOVERNOR, And that justifies dressing up?
 listen to me," for your own physical safety do not speak, do not indulge in any non-verbal signals suggestive of internal thought. If the safety of my sister is compromised; if the security of my sister is compromised; if the incarceration of my sister is compromised – in short, if I find any indication my sister has left this island at any time, I swear to you, you will not."
GOVERNOR, Why?
MYCROFT, He talked me out of Lady Bracknell. This could have been very different.
MYCROFT, Are you in?
SHERLOCK, Just arriving at the Secure Unit. Explain.
AUTOMATED VOICE, Door opening.
MYCROFT," Since you’re determined to meet her, you’re about to find out."
MYCROFT, Answer yes or no. Has there ever been – against my express instructions – any attempt at a psychiatric evaluation of Eurus Holmes?
GOVERNOR, Yes.
MYCROFT, I presume the tapes are in my office?
GOVERNOR, Your office?
GUARD," You ’aven’t been down ’ere before, ’ave you? “Silence of the Lambs,” basically."
GUARD, Keep your distance; stay at least three feet away from the glass an’ all that.
SHERLOCK, Why the headphones?
GUARD," She doesn’t stop playin’, sometimes for weeks."
GUARD, Kills you in the end.
SHERLOCK," Aye. Still beautiful, though."
AUTOMATED VOICE, Door closing.
s note," I’m told by several people that the accent which Sherlock used is Scottish, not northern Irish.  Even after listening to a video explaining the tendencies of Irish accents, I still hear Irish, so I’m leaving it here but bear in mind I could well be wrong.]"
EURUS, Why am I here?
EURUS, No-one ever tells me.
EURUS, Am I being punished?
EURUS," Good and bad are fairytales. We have evolved to attach an emotional significance to what is nothing more than the survival strategy of the pack animal. We are conditioned to invest divinity in utility. Good isn’t really good, evil isn’t really wrong, and bottoms aren’t really pretty. You are a prisoner of your own meat."
EURUS, Did you bring it?
SHERLOCK, I’m sorry?
EURUS, My hairband. Did you bring it like I asked?
EURUS, My special hairband.
EURUS," It was the last thing I said to you, remember, the day they took me away."
EURUS, No?
SHERLOCK," No, we’ve spoken since then. You came round to my flat a few weeks back; you pretended to be a woman called Faith Smith. We had chips."
EURUS, Does this mean you didn’t bring my hairband?
SHERLOCK, How did you manage to get out of this place? How did you do that?
EURUS, Easy. Look at me.
SHERLOCK, I am looking at you.
EURUS," You can’t see it, can you? You try and try but you just can’t see; you can’t look."
SHERLOCK, See what?
EURUS, What do you think?
SHERLOCK, Beautiful.
EURUS, You’re not looking at it.
SHERLOCK, I meant your playing.
EURUS," Oh, the music. (She lowers the violin and turns it round to look at the front.) I never know if it’s beautiful or not; only if it’s right."
SHERLOCK, Often they’re the same thing.
EURUS, Look at the violin.
SHERLOCK, I need to know how you escaped.
SHERLOCK, It’s a Stradivarius.
EURUS, It’s a gift.
SHERLOCK, Who from?
EURUS, Me.
SHERLOCK, Why?
SHERLOCK, How did you know?
EURUS," How did I know? I taught you, don’t you remember? How can you not remember that?"
SHERLOCK," Eurus, I don’t remember you at all."
SHERLOCK," What do you mean, “rewritten”?"
EURUS," You still don’t know about Redbeard, do you?"
EURUS, Oh. This is going to be such a good day.
GOVERNOR, Everyone we sent in there; it-it’s hard to describe.
GOVERNOR, It’s ... it’s like she ...
MYCROFT, ... recruited them.
GOVERNOR, Enslaved them.
MYCROFT, She’s been capable of that since she was five.
MYCROFT, She’s an adult now. I warned you; I ordered you.
GOVERNOR, She’s clinically unique. We had to try.
MYCROFT, At what cost?
MYCROFT, Tell me the worst thing that has happened.
MYCROFT, And?
GOVERNOR, He said it was like an earworm; couldn’t get her out of his head.
MYCROFT, And?
GOVERNOR, He left.
MYCROFT, And?
GOVERNOR, Killed himself.
GOVERNOR, ... his family.
EURUS, It’s okay if you cry.
EURUS, I can help you cry.
EURUS, Play for me.
SHERLOCK, I need to know how you got out of here.
SHERLOCK, Me?
EURUS, You.
EURUS, Oh! Have you had sex?
EURUS, The music. I’ve had sex.
SHERLOCK, How?
EURUS," One of the nurses got careless. I liked it. Messy, though. People are so breakable."
EURUS, He?
SHERLOCK, She?
EURUS," Afraid I didn’t notice in the heat of the moment and afterwards ... well, you couldn’t really tell. Is that vibrato or is your hand shaking?"
 I warned you explicitly, no-one was to talk to her alone.
GOVERNOR, You spoke to her.
GOVERNOR, You even brought her a visitor on Christmas Day.
GOVERNOR, You gave her a Christmas present. Remember her Christmas present?
JOHN, What dangers?
MYCROFT, Anyone who spends time with her is automatically compromised.
EURUS, Helping someone ... (she nods) ... is the best way you can help yourself.
SHERLOCK, So clearly you remember me.
s VOICE, Vatican Cameos.
SHERLOCK, In a minute.
EURUS, Let’s continue.
EURUS, Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass? 
SHERLOCK, Yes.
EURUS, Be naughty. Step closer.
SHERLOCK, Why?
EURUS, Do it. Step closer.
SHERLOCK, Tell me what you remember.
EURUS," You, me, and Mycroft. (She sighs a little.) Mycroft was quite clever. He could understand things if you went a bit slow but you ... you were my favourite."
SHERLOCK, Why was I your favourite?
EURUS, ’Cause I could make you laugh. I loved it when you laughed. Once I made you laugh all night. I thought you were going to burst.
EURUS, I was so happy.
EURUS," Then Mummy and Daddy had to stop me, of course."
SHERLOCK, Why?
SHERLOCK, Why was I screaming?
SHERLOCK, I remember Redbeard.
EURUS, Touch the glass.
MYCROFT," I put my trust in you, my implicit trust."
MYCROFT, As governor of this institute ...
GOVERNOR," It’s obvious when it all started. Well, she was never the same after that Christmas. It’s as if you woke her up."
MYCROFT, That is entirely beside the point! You had your orders and failed to act on them.
MYCROFT, Sorry?
JOHN, Do it now. Listen.
MYCROFT, My sister’s methods of ...
SHERLOCK, Redbeard was my dog. I know what happened to Redbeard.
EURUS," I’ll touch it too, if you’re scared."
EURUS," I can fix her for you, and then I’ll give you her straight back, good as new."
EURUS, I promise.
JOHN," Everyone who went in there got affected – “enslaved,” you said."
JOHN, One after the other.
GOVERNOR, Yes.
JOHN," If Eurus has enslaved you, then who exactly is in charge of this prison?"
JOHN, No.
JOHN, No.
SHERLOCK, It’s more common than you’d think.
EURUS, Do you see how it was done? I know you like explanations.
EURUS, And my voice? Throat mic. Puts me through the speakers.
EURUS, Don’t you think it’s clever? Simple but clever?
EURUS," Well, you do keep asking me how I got out of here."
EURUS," Get in here, all of you! Stop me killing him!"
EURUS," No, no. Stop me in a minute."
VOICE, Red alert! Red alert! Big bad bouncy red alert!
JIM, Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me?
GOVERNOR, Mr Moriarty.
JIM, Big G.
JIM," “Big G.” Means “governor.” Street speak. I’m a bit down with the kids, you know? I’m relatable that way. D’you like my boys?"
JIM," This one’s got more stamina, but he’s less caring in the afterglow."
GOVERNOR," This way, please."
JIM, Smell all that insane criminality.
JIM, Do you have cannibals here?
GOVERNOR, Yes.
JIM, How many?
GOVERNOR, Three.
MYCROFT, Won’t you sit down?
MYCROFT," You know what this place is, of course?"
MYCROFT," You remain a person of interest, but until you commit a verifiable crime you are – I regret – at liberty."
JIM, Then why am I here?
MYCROFT, You’re a Christmas present.
JIM, Ah. (He walks across the room to Mycroft’s side of the table and holds out his arms as he walks past him.) How’d you want me?
MYCROFT," She predicted the exact dates of the last three terrorist attacks on the British mainland after an hour on Twitter. That sort of thing. In return, however, she requires treats. Last year it was a violin."
JIM, This year?
MYCROFT, Five minutes’ unsupervised conversation ... with you.
JIM," Me?! (Smiling, he turns towards Mycroft and blinks mock-bashfully before lifting one hand to his chest, pretending to look amazed.) With me?!"
MYCROFT, She has noted your interest in the activities of my little brother.
JIM, Whatever you’re about to tell me ...
JIM, ... awesome!
JIM, I’m your Christmas present.
SHERLOCK, How are you?
JOHN, Bit of a lump.
SHERLOCK," True dat, but you have your uses."
JOHN, Did you see your sister?
SHERLOCK, Yes.
SHERLOCK, Family’s always difficult.
JOHN, Are we phoning someone?
SHERLOCK, Apparently.
JOHN, What’s he doing here?
SHERLOCK, As he is told. (He stops and turns to John.) Eurus is in control.
GIRL, Help me!
s VOICE, Hello. My name’s Jim Moriarty. 
s VOICE, Welcome ... to the final problem.
SHERLOCK, It’s okay. He’s dead.
JOHN, He doesn’t sound dead.
s VOICE, This is a recorded announcement.
s VOICE, Please say hullo to some very old friends of mine.
GIRL, Hello? I can hear you talking. Please help me! I’m on a plane and it’s going to crash!
MYCROFT, Is this supposed to be a game?
GIRL, I’m not supposed to tell my name to strangers.
SHERLOCK," Of course not. Very good. But, um, I’ll tell you mine. My name is ..."
SHERLOCK, Hello?
EURUS, Oh dear. We seem to have lost the connection.
MYCROFT, How have you done this? How is any of this possible?
JOHN, How can that be Moriarty?
EURUS," Oh, he recorded lots of little messages for me before he died."
EURUS, Loved it. Did you know his brother was a station master? I think he was always jealous.
SHERLOCK, The girl – where is she? Can I talk to her again?
EURUS," Poor little thing. Alone in the sky in a great big plane with nowhere to land. But where in the world is she? It’s a clever little puzzle. If you want to apply yourself to it, I can reconnect you; but first ..."
GOVERNOR," That’s my wife! (He stares at the screen as Eurus turns her head to look into the camera.) Oh, God, that’s my wife!"
EURUS, I’m going to shoot the governor’s wife.
GOVERNOR," Please, no. (He gestures vaguely towards Sherlock as if begging him, though he keeps his eyes on the screen.) Please. Help her!"
SHERLOCK, Please don’t do that.
EURUS," Well, you can stop me."
SHERLOCK, How?
EURUS, There’s a gun in the hatch. Take it.
EURUS, You want to save the governor’s wife? Choose either Doctor Watson or Mycroft to kill the governor.
GOVERNOR, Oh ... oh God!
EURUS," You can’t do it, Sherlock. If you do it, it won’t count. I’ll kill her anyway. It has to be your brother or your friend."
GOVERNOR, You have to do this.
GOVERNOR, Eurus will kill her.
SHERLOCK, Doesn’t appear we have a choice.
EURUS, Countdown starting.
MYCROFT, How long?
EURUS," No, no, no. The countdown is for me. "
EURUS," Withholding the precise deadline will apply the emotional pressure more evenly. Where possible, please give me an explicit verbal indication of your anxiety levels."
EURUS, I can’t always read them from your behaviour.
EURUS," I’m particularly focussed on internal conflicts, where strategising around a largely intuitive moral code appears to create a counter-intuitive result."
MYCROFT, I will not kill. I will not have blood on my hands.
EURUS," Yes, very good. (She turns away from the camera and looks across the office.) Thank you."
SHERLOCK," Okay, fine."
GOVERNOR, Doctor Watson. Are you married?
GOVERNOR, What happened?
JOHN, She died.
GOVERNOR, What would you do to save her?
GOVERNOR, Eurus will kill me. Please save my wife.
EURUS," There will, I’m afraid, be regular prompts to create an atmosphere of urgency."
JIM," Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick ..."
JIM," Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tock, tick-tock ..."
GOVERNOR, David.
JOHN," And you’re sure about this, David?"
EURUS, Nearly there.
JOHN," Right. D’you want to ... pray, or anything?"
GOVERNOR," With Eurus Holmes in the world, who the hell would I pray to?"
JOHN," You are a good man, and you are doing a good thing."
JOHN, I’ll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.
GOVERNOR, Be quick!
EURUS," This is very good, Doctor Watson."
EURUS, I should have fitted you with a cardiograph.
JIM, Tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock tick-tick-tick.
JOHN, I can’t. (He lowers the gun and turns to Sherlock.) I’m sorry. I can’t do it.
SHERLOCK, I know. It’s all right.
JOHN," Stop! No, no, stop."
SHERLOCK, It’s all right.
GOVERNOR, I’m so sorry.
SHERLOCK, No!
JOHN, No!
SHERLOCK, Are you all right?
EURUS, Interesting.
SHERLOCK," All right, there you go. You got what you wanted ... (he breathes sharply for a moment) ... and he’s dead."
EURUS," Dead or alive ... (she spins on her chair to face the screen) ... he really wasn’t very interesting, but you three ... (she leans closer to the camera) ... you three were wonderful. Thank you. (She leans even closer.) You see, what you did, Doctor Watson ..."
EURUS, ... specifically because of your moral code ...
EURUS," ... because you don’t want blood on your hands, two people are dead instead of one."
JOHN, Two people?
EURUS," Yes. Sorry, hang on."
JOHN, Oh!
EURUS, What advantage did your moral code grant you?
EURUS," Is it not, in the end, selfish to keep one’s hands clean at the expense of another’s life?"
JOHN, You didn’t have to kill her!
EURUS, The condition of her survival was that you or Mycroft had to kill her husband.
EURUS," This is an experiment. There will be rigour. Sherlock, pick up the gun. It’s your turn next. "
EURUS, When I tell you to use it – and I will – remember what happened this time.
EURUS," Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy."
SHERLOCK, For whom?
EURUS, You.
EURUS," If someone else had to die, would you really want to do it with your bare hands? It would waste valuable time."
JOHN, Probably just take it.
SHERLOCK, There’s only one bullet left.
EURUS, You will only need one. But you will need it.
EURUS," Please, go through. There’s a few tasks for you, and a girl on a plane is getting very, very scared."
SHERLOCK, Treats?
MYCROFT," Yes. You know, a violin."
SHERLOCK, In exchange for ...?
MYCROFT, She’s very clever.
s VOICE, Come on now! Aaaaaall aboard! (High-pitched) Choo-choo! Choo-choo!
SHERLOCK, Someone’s been redecorating.
JOHN, Is that allowed?
SHERLOCK, She’s literally taken over the asylum. We have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.
MYCROFT, Barely dry. Recent.
SHERLOCK, It’s for our benefit.
EURUS," As a motivator to your continued co-operation, I’m now reconnecting you."
s VOICE, Are-are you still there?
SHERLOCK," Yes, hello?"
SHERLOCK, Hello. We’re still here. Can you hear us?
GIRL, Yes.
GIRL, Night.
GIRL," Um, I don’t know."
JOHN, Is it big or small?
GIRL, Big.
JOHN, Lots of people on it?
GIRL," Lots and lots, but they’re all asleep. I can’t wake them up."
SHERLOCK, Where did you take off from?
GIRL, Even the driver’s asleep.
SHERLOCK," No, I understand; but where did you come from? Where did the plane take off?"
GIRL, My nan’s.
SHERLOCK, And where are you going?
GIRL, Home.
SHERLOCK," No, I mean what airport are you ..."
MYCROFT, This is inhuman; this is insane!
EURUS," Six months ago, a man called Evans was murdered; unsolved except by me."
EURUS, He was shot from a distance of three hundred metres with this rifle.
EURUS," Now, if the police had any brains they’d realise there are three suspects, all brothers. Nathan Garrideb, Alex Garrideb and Howard Garrideb."
EURUS," All these photos are up-to-date, but which one pulled the trigger, Sherlock? Which one?"
EURUS," Please, make use of your friends, Sherlock. I want to see you interact with people that you’re close to. Also, you may have to choose which one to keep."
SHERLOCK, What do you make of it?
MYCROFT, Am I being asked to prove my usefulness?
SHERLOCK," Yes, I should think you are."
MYCROFT, I will not be manipulated like this.
SHERLOCK, Fine. John?
JOHN," Yeah, I think I’ve seen one of these. It’s a buffalo gun. (He raises the rifle and aims it towards the floor at the other end of the room, looking into the telescopic sight.) I’d say nineteen forties, old-fashioned sight, no crosshairs."
SHERLOCK," Glasses, glasses. (He points to the first photograph.) Nathan wears glasses. Evans was shot from three hundred metres."
SHERLOCK, Kickback from a gun with this calibre ...
SHERLOCK," No cuts, no scarring. Not Nathan, then. (He turns the photo over.) Who’s next?"
MYCROFT, Do you have a suspicion we’re being made to compete?
JOHN, ... and that means to hell with what happens to us.
MYCROFT," Oh, dear God."
EURUS," Two of the Garridebs work here as orderlies, so getting the third along really wasn’t too difficult."
EURUS," Once you bring in your verdict, let me know and justice will be done."
SHERLOCK, Justice?
JOHN, What will you do with them?
EURUS, Early release.
SHERLOCK, You’ll drop them into the sea.
EURUS," Sink, or swim."
EURUS, Exactly! Now there is context.
EURUS," Please, continue with your deductions. I’m now focussing on the difference to your mental capacity a specified consequence can make."
MYCROFT," What if we’re disinclined to play your games, little sister?"
EURUS, I have – if you remember – provided you with some motivation.
SHERLOCK, Oh. That’s nice. Try to tell me more about the plane. 
GIRL, Why won’t my mummy wake up?
SHERLOCK, There’s no way he could have taken that shot from three hundred metres away.
SHERLOCK, So that leaves us with Alex.
MYCROFT," He’s shortsighted, or he was. His recent laser surgery has done the trick."
MYCROFT, Look at his clothes. He’s made an effort.
SHERLOCK, But he got his eyes fixed. His hands were steady. He pulled the trigger.
SHERLOCK, He killed Evans.
EURUS, Are you ready to condemn the prisoner?
MYCROFT," Sherlock, we can’t do this."
SHERLOCK, Alex.
EURUS, Say it. Condemn him.
EURUS, Condemn him in the knowledge of what will happen to the man you name.
EURUS, Congratulations. 
EURUS, You got the right one.
EURUS," Now, go through the door."
EURUS," Does it really make a difference, killing the innocent instead of the guilty? (She looks down thoughtfully.) Let’s see."
JIM, The train has left the station!
SHERLOCK, Don’t let her distract you.
EURUS, One more minute on the phone.
GIRL, Frightened. I’m really frightened.
SHERLOCK," It’s okay, don’t worry."
GIRL, Just the sea. I can see the sea.
SHERLOCK, Are there ships on it?
GIRL, No ships. I can see lights in the distance.
SHERLOCK, Is it a city?
GIRL, I think so.
MYCROFT, She’s about to fly over a city in a pilotless plane. We’ll have to talk her through it.
SHERLOCK, Still here. Just give us a minute.
JOHN, No. W-we could help her land it.
MYCROFT," And if we fail, and she crashes into a city? How many will die then?"
JOHN, How are we gonna get her to do that?
GIRL, Everyone’s asleep. Will you help me?
SHERLOCK, We’re going to do everything that we can.
GIRL, I’m scared. I’m really scared.
SHERLOCK, It’s all right. I ...
EURUS, Coffin. Problem: someone is about to die. It will be – as I understand it – a tragedy. 
EURUS," Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."
EURUS," Whose coffin, Sherlock? Please, start your deductions. I will apply some context in a moment."
SHERLOCK," Well, allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom, I’d say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot four. Makes it more likely to be a woman."
JOHN, Not a child?
SHERLOCK," A child’s coffin would be more expensive. This is in the lower price range, although still best available in that bracket."
SHERLOCK, This is a practical and informed choice. Balance of probability suggests that this is for an unmarried woman distant from her close relatives. That much is suggested by the economy of choice.
MYCROFT, Only it isn’t a name.
JOHN," So, it’s for somebody who loves somebody."
MYCROFT, It’s for somebody who loves Sherlock. (Looking towards his brother) This is all about you. Everything here.
MYCROFT, So who loves you? I’m assuming it’s not a long list.
JOHN, Irene Adler.
SHERLOCK," Don’t be ridiculous. Look at the coffin. Unmarried, practical about death, alone."
JOHN, Molly.
SHERLOCK, Molly Hooper.
EURUS," She’s perfectly safe, for the moment."
EURUS," ... unless I hear the release code from her lips. I’m calling her on your phone, Sherlock. Make her say it."
JOHN, Say what?
EURUS," Obvious, surely?"
SHERLOCK, Yes.
 one important restriction, you’re not allowed to mention in any way at all that her life is in danger.
EURUS," You may not – at any point – suggest that there is any form of crisis. If you do, I will end this session and her life. Are we clear?"
SHERLOCK, What’s she doing?
MYCROFT, She’s making tea.
SHERLOCK," Yes, but why isn’t she answering her phone? "
s VOICE, Leave a message.
SHERLOCK," No, it’s not a game. I ... need you to help me."
MOLLY," Look, I’m not at the lab."
SHERLOCK, It’s not about that.
JIM," Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick."
MOLLY, Leave me alone.
EURUS," Calmly, Sherlock, or I will finish her right now."
MOLLY, Why are you doing this to me? Why are you making fun of me?
EURUS," Softer, Sherlock!"
SHERLOCK," Molly, this is for a case. It’s ... it’s a sort of experiment."
MOLLY," I’m not an experiment, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK," No, I know you’re not an experiment. You’re my friend. We’re friends. But ... please. Just ... say those words for me."
MOLLY, I can’t say that. I can’t ... I can’t say that to you.
MOLLY, You know why.
MOLLY, Of course you do.
JIM," Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick-tick-tick ..."
SHERLOCK," Please, just say it. (He blinks rapidly.)"
SHERLOCK, Why?
MOLLY," Because ... it’s ... (she takes a breath and starts to cry) ... true, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK," Well, if it’s true, just say it anyway."
MOLLY, You bastard.
MOLLY, You say it. Go on. You say it first.
SHERLOCK, What?
EURUS, Final thirty seconds.
SHERLOCK, I love you.
SHERLOCK, Molly?
SHERLOCK," Molly, please."
MOLLY, I love you.
MYCROFT," Sherlock, however hard that was ..."
 The girl on the plane, I need to talk to her.
SHERLOCK, I won. I saved Molly Hooper.
EURUS," Saved her? From what? Oh, do be sensible. There were no explosives in her little house. Why would I be so clumsy? You didn’t win. You lost."
EURUS, Look what you did to her. Look what you did to yourself.
EURUS," All those complicated little emotions. I lost count. Emotional context, Sherlock. It destroys you every time."
EURUS," Now, please, pull yourself together. I need you at peak efficiency. The next one isn’t going to be so easy."
EURUS, In your own time.
JOHN, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK, No. No.
SHERLOCK, Soldiers?
JIM," Tick-tock, tickets please!"
SHERLOCK," Hey, sis, don’t mean to complain but this one’s empty. What happened? Did you run out of ideas?"
EURUS," It’s not empty, Sherlock. You’ve still got the gun, haven’t you? I told you you’d need it, because only two can play the next game. Just two of you go on from here; your choice. (She smiles brightly into the camera.) It’s make-your-mind-up time. Whose help do you need the most – John or Mycroft?"
EURUS, It’s an elimination round. You choose one and kill the other. You have to choose family or friend. Mycroft or John Watson?
JIM, Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.
MYCROFT," Eurus, enough!"
MYCROFT, Well?
SHERLOCK," Well, what?"
MYCROFT," We’re not actually going to discuss this, are we?"
MYCROFT," I’m sorry, Doctor Watson. You’re a fine man in many respects."
MYCROFT, Make your goodbyes and shoot him.
MYCROFT, Shoot him!
MYCROFT," Shoot Doctor Watson. There’s no question who has to continue from here. It’s us; you and me. Whatever lies ahead requires brainpower, Sherlock, not sentiment. Don’t prolong his agony; shoot him."
JOHN, Do I get a say in this?
MYCROFT," I regret, Doctor Watson, that privilege is now yours."
JOHN, Shit.
JOHN, He’s right.
JOHN," He is, in fact, right."
MYCROFT," God! (He puts his hands in his trouser pockets, grinning.) I should have expected this. (His smile drops.) Pathetic. You always were the slow one ..."
MYCROFT," ... the idiot. That’s why I’ve always despised you. You shame us all. You shame the family name. Now, for once in your life, do the right thing. (He tilts his head towards John.) Put this stupid little man out of all our misery."
MYCROFT, Shoot him.
MYCROFT, Look at him. What is he?
MYCROFT," Nothing more than a distraction; a little scrap of ordinariness for you to impress, to dazzle with your cleverness. You’ll find another."
MYCROFT, Why?
SHERLOCK, Which is why this is going to be so much harder.
MYCROFT, You said you liked my Lady Bracknell.
MYCROFT," Not in the face, though, please. I’ve promised my brain to the Royal Society."
SHERLOCK, Where would you suggest?
MYCROFT, Well ... (he starts doing up the top button of his shirt) ... I suppose there is a heart somewhere inside me. (He looks down and straightens his tie.) I don’t imagine it’s much of a target but ...
MYCROFT, This is my fault.
MYCROFT, Moriarty.
SHERLOCK, Moriarty?
MYCROFT, Her Christmas treat: five minutes’ conversation with Jim Moriarty five years ago.
SHERLOCK, What did they discuss?
MYCROFT, Five minutes’ conversation ...
MYCROFT, ... unsupervised.
MYCROFT," Goodbye, brother mine. No flowers ... (he puts his hands behind his back) ... by request."
EURUS, Jim Moriarty thought you’d make this choice. He was so excited.
JIM," And here we are, at the end of the line. Holmes killing Holmes."
JIM, This is where I get off.
EURUS, What are you doing?
SHERLOCK, I’m remembering the governor.
EURUS," No, no, Sherlock."
SHERLOCK, Nine ...
SHERLOCK, Eight ...
EURUS, You can’t!
SHERLOCK, Seven ...
SHERLOCK, Six ...
SHERLOCK, Five ...
SHERLOCK, Four ...
SHERLOCK, How-how-how long was I away?
GIRL, Hours. Hours and hours. Why don’t grown-ups tell the truth?
GIRL, Where did you go?
SHERLOCK," Um, now, I tell you what. You-you’ve got to be really, really brave for me."
SHERLOCK, Can you go to the front of the plane? Can you do that?
GIRL, The front?
SHERLOCK, Yes.
SHERLOCK, That’s right; the front.
GIRL, You mean where the driver is?
GIRL, Okay. (She starts to get up from the floor.) I’m going.
SHERLOCK, Are you there yet?
JOHN," Yeah, I’m here."
SHERLOCK, John!
SHERLOCK, Where are you?
JOHN, I don’t know. I’ve just woken up. Where are you?
SHERLOCK, I’m in another cell. I just spoke to the girl on the plane again. We’ve been out for hours.
JOHN," What, she’s still up there?"
SHERLOCK, Yes. (His voice comes over John’s earpiece.) The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel.
SHERLOCK, Is Mycroft with you?
JOHN, I have no idea. I can hardly see anything. (He calls out.) Mycroft? Mycroft?
SHERLOCK, Are you okay?
JOHN, Yeah.
SHERLOCK," All right. Well, just keep exploring. Tell me anything you can about where you are."
JOHN," The walls are ... (he puts a hand on the wall and feels it) ... rough. They’re rock, I guess."
SHERLOCK, What are you standing on?
 But listen, there’s about two feet of water.
JOHN," Chains. (He shakes his head.) Yeah, my feet are chained up. I can feel something."
JOHN," Bones, Sherlock."
JOHN, There are bones in here.
SHERLOCK, What kind of bones?
JOHN," Uh, I dunno. S-small."
SHERLOCK," Oh, hello. Are you at the front of the plane now?"
SHERLOCK," All right. Well, you and I are going to have to drive this plane together. (He slowly stands, looking up towards the sky.) Just you and me."
SHERLOCK," Now, um, can you see anything that looks like a radio?"
GIRL, No. 
SHERLOCK," That’s all right. Well, we ... keep looking. We’ve got plenty of time."
SHERLOCK, What’s wrong?
GIRL, The whole plane’s shaking.
SHERLOCK, It’s just turbulence. It’s nothing to worry about.
GIRL, My ears hurt.
SHERLOCK, Does the river look like it’s getting closer?
GIRL, A-a little bit.
SHERLOCK," All right, then. That means you’re nearly home."
JOHN, I’m in a well. That’s where I am; I’m in the bottom of a well.
SHERLOCK, Why would there be a well in Sherrinford?
SHERLOCK, Why is there a draught? 
SHERLOCK, Walls don’t contract after you’ve painted them.
SHERLOCK, I’m home. Musgrave Hall.
EURUS, ... which reminded me of home.
SHERLOCK," Yeah, still not interested. The plane!"
EURUS, You knew he’d take his revenge. His revenge apparently is me.
EURUS," I’m letting the water in now. You don’t want me to drown another one of your pets, do you? At long last, Sherlock Holmes, it’s time to solve the Musgrave ritual."
EURUS, Your very first case! And the final problem. (Her voice drops to a whisper.) Oh. Bye-bye.
JOHN, Sherlock?
 VOICE," ♪ I that am lost / Oh, who will find me / Deep down below ..."
JOHN, Sherlock!
 VOICE, ♪ The old beech tree?
 VOICE, ♪ Help succour me now ... 
SHERLOCK, John.
 VOICE, ♪ The East winds blow ...
SHERLOCK, John. (Shouting) John? Can you hear me? John!
 VOICE," ♪ Sixteen by six, brother, and under we go ..."
GIRL," Help me! Help me, please!"
 VOICE, ♪ Be not afraid ...
SHERLOCK, John.
GIRL," It’s leaning over, the whole plane!"
SHERLOCK," Eurus, you said the answer’s in the song ..."
SHERLOCK, ... but I went through the song line by line all those years ago ...
SHERLOCK, ... and I found nothing. I couldn’t find anything. And there-there was a beech tree in the grounds and I dug.
SHERLOCK, I dug and dug and dug and dug. Sixteen feet by six; sixteen yards; sixteen metres – and I found nothing. No-one.
EURUS, Emotional context. And he-e-e-e-re it comes.
JOHN, Sherlock? (He’s standing up in the water staring in anguish at something we can’t yet see.) The bones I found.
JOHN, Mycroft’s been lying to you; to both of us.
JOHN, They’re not dogs’ bones.
EURUS, Remember Daddy’s allergy? What was he allergic to?
EURUS," What would he never let you have all those times you begged? Well, he’d never let you have a dog."
SHERLOCK, We played pirates. I was Yellowbeard and he was ...
SHERLOCK, ... he was Redbeard.
EURUS, You were inseparable. But I wanted to play too.
SHERLOCK, Oh. Oh God.
SHERLOCK, What ... (he pulls in several breaths before he can continue) ... what did you do?
VICTOR," Please let me out! Please, someone help me! Please."
SHERLOCK, You killed my best friend.
SHERLOCK, Need your help. I’m trying to solve a puzzle.
SHERLOCK," Well, the puzzle will save the plane."
SHERLOCK, The wrong dates. She used the wrong dates on the gravestones as the key to the cipher ... (he runs to shine the lantern on Nemo Holmes’ gravestone) ... and the cipher was the song.
SHERLOCK," Yes, it is. I’ll be with you in a minute."
SHERLOCK, Let’s number the words of the song.
SHERLOCK, Then rearrange the numbered words to match the sequence on the gravestones.
s note," for this to work, we have to assume that the second large verse is actually the fourth verse of the song.])"
SHERLOCK, I ... am ... lost ... Help ... me ... brother ... Save ... My ... Life ... Before ... my ... Doom.
SHERLOCK, I ... am ... Lost ... Without ... your ... love ... Save ... My ... soul ... seek ... my ... room.
GIRL, We’re going to crash! I’m going to die!
SHERLOCK, I think it’s time you told me your real name.
SHERLOCK, I’m your brother.
EURUS," You’re playing with me, Sherlock. We’re playing the game."
SHERLOCK," The game, yes. I get it now. (He steps closer to her.) The song was never a set of directions."
SHERLOCK," Look how brilliant you are. Your mind has created the perfect metaphor. You’re high above us, all alone in the sky, and you understand everything except how to land. (He shifts round and sits down in front of her, breathless and anxious.) Now, I’m just an idiot, but I’m on the ground. (He reaches out and puts his fingers onto her hands.) I can bring you home."
EURUS," No, no. (She shivers.) It’s too late now."
EURUS," Every time I close my eyes, I’m on the plane. I’m lost, lost in the sky and ... no-one can hear me."
SHERLOCK, Eurus ...
SHERLOCK, Help me save John Watson.
LESTRADE, I just spoke to your brother.
LESTRADE," He’s a bit shaken up, that’s all. She didn’t hurt him; she just locked him in her old cell."
JOHN, What goes around comes around.
LESTRADE," Yeah. Give me a moment, boys."
SHERLOCK," Oh, um. Mycroft – make sure he’s looked after. He’s not as strong as he thinks he is."
SHERLOCK," Thanks, Greg."
POLICE OFFICER, Mm-hm.
LESTRADE," Let’s move her, then."
POLICE OFFICER," Is that him, sir? Sherlock Holmes?"
LESTRADE," Fan, are you?"
POLICE OFFICER," Well, he’s a great man, sir."
LESTRADE," No, he’s better than that. (He looks towards Sherlock for a moment.) He’s a good one."
JOHN," Well, you gave her what she was looking for: context."
JOHN," It’s not good, it’s not bad. It’s ..."
JOHN, It is what it is.
MYCROFT," What Uncle Rudy began ... (he hesitates slightly, his eyes lowered) ... I thought it best to continue."
MYCROFT, I was trying to be kind.
MRS HOLMES, Kind?! (She gasps in a pained breath.) Kind? (She becomes tearful as she continues.) You told us that our daughter was dead.
MYCROFT, Better that than tell you what she had become.
MYCROFT, I’m sorry.
MR HOLMES," Whatever she became, whatever she is now, Mycroft ..."
MYCROFT, And my sister.
MRS HOLMES, Then you should have done better.
MRS HUDSON, Then he’s very limited.
MR HOLMES, Where is she?
MYCROFT," Back in Sherrinford; secure, this time. (He looks at his father.) People have died."
MR HOLMES, When can we see her?
MYCROFT, She has passed beyond our view.
MRS HOLMES, Well?
JOHN," Uh, yeah, I-I think you’d better get round here."
MARY, P.S.
 you listen to me," who you really are, it doesn’t matter."
SHERLOCK," Oh, there’s Daddy!"
MARY, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.
